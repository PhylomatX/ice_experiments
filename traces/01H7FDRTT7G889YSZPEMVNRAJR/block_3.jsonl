There is a long history of scaling for language models, for both the model and dataset sizes. Brants et al. (2007) showed the benefits of using language models trained on 2 trillion tokens, resulting in 300 billion n-grams, on the quality of machine translation. In the context of neural language models, Jozefowicz et al. ( 2016) obtained state-of-the-art results on the Billion Word benchmark by scaling LSTMs to 1 billion parameters. Later, scaling transformers lead to improvement on many NLP tasks. Notable models include BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) , GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) , Megatron-LM (Shoeybi et al., 2019), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). A significant breakthrough was obtained with GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) , a model with 175 billion parameters. This lead to a series of Large Language Models, such as Jurassic-1 (Lieber et al., 2021), Megatron-Turing NLG (Smith et al., 2022) , Gopher (Rae et al., 2021) , Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022 ), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022 , OPT (Zhang et al., 2022), and GLM (Zeng et al., 2022) .  Hestness et al. (2017) and Rosenfeld et al. (2019) studied the impact of scaling on the performance of deep learning models, showing the existence of power laws between the model and dataset sizes and the performance of the system. Kaplan et al. ( 2020) derived power laws specifically for transformer based language models, which were later refined by Hoffmann et al. (2022) , by adapting the learning rate schedule when scaling datasets. Finally, Wei et al. (2022) studied the effect of scaling on the abilities of large language models."},"\"\n\nQuestion: Does this paragraph answer the question '",{"source":"question","value":"How many parameters are used in the model?","formatted":"How many parameters are used in the model?"},"'?

(2007) showed the benefits of using language models trained on 2 trillion tokens, resulting in 300 billion n-grams, on the quality of machine translation. In the context of neural language models, Jozefowicz et al. ( 2016) obtained state-of-the-art results on the Billion Word benchmark by scaling LSTMs to 1 billion parameters. Later, scaling transformers lead to improvement on many NLP tasks. Notable models include BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) , GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) , Megatron-LM (Shoeybi et al., 2019), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). A significant breakthrough was obtained with GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) , a model with 175 billion parameters. This lead to a series of Large Language Models, such as Jurassic-1 (Lieber et al., 2021), Megatron-Turing NLG (Smith et al., 2022) , Gopher (Rae et al., 2021) , Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022 ), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022 , OPT (Zhang et al., 2022), and GLM (Zeng et al., 2022) .  Hestness et al. (2017) and Rosenfeld et al. (2019) studied the impact of scaling on the performance of deep learning models, showing the existence of power laws between the model and dataset sizes and the performance of the system. Kaplan et al. ( 2020) derived power laws specifically for transformer based language models, which were later refined by Hoffmann et al.

{"input":"As show in Table 8 , for a similar number of parameters, LLaMA outperforms other general models such as LaMDA and PaLM, which are not trained or finetuned specifically for code. LLaMA with 13B parameters and more outperforms LaMDA 137B on both HumanEval and MBPP. LLaMA 65B also outperforms PaLM 62B, even when it is trained longer. The pass@1 results reported in this table were obtained by sampling with temperature 0.1. The pass@100 and pass@80 metrics were obtained with temperature 0.8. We use the same method as Chen et al. ( 2021) to obtain unbiased estimates of the pass@k.","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}
