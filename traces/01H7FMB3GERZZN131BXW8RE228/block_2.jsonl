{"prompt":"Here is a paragraph from a research paper: \"Neural language representation models such as BERT pre-trained on large-scale corpora can well capture rich semantic patterns from plain text, and be fine-tuned to consistently improve the performance of various NLP tasks. However, the existing pre-trained language models rarely consider incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs), which can provide rich structured knowledge facts for better language understanding. We argue that informative entities in KGs can enhance language representation with external knowledge. In this paper, we utilize both large-scale textual corpora and KGs to train an enhanced language representation model (ERNIE), which can take full advantage of lexical, syntactic, and knowledge information simultaneously.

From Table 5, we have two observations: (1) As the training data does not have enough instances to train the CNN encoder from scratch, CNN just achieves an F1 score of 69.35%. However, the pre-training models including BERT and ERNIE increase the F1 score by at least 15%. (2) ERNIE achieves an absolute F1 increase of 3.4% over BERT, which means fusing external knowledge is very effective.\"\n\nQuestion: Does this paragraph answer the question 'What are the main contributions?'?

The results of CNN, PA-LSTM, and C-GCN come from the paper by Zhang et al. (2018), which are the best results of CNN, RNN, and GCN respectively. From Table 5 , we observe that: (1) The C-GCN model outperforms the strong BERT model by an F1 increase of 0.4%, as C-GCN utilizes the dependency trees and the entity mask strategy. The entity mask strategy refers to replacing each subject (and object similarly) entity with a special NER token, which is similar to our proposed pre-training task dEA. (2) ERNIE achieves the best recall and F1 scores, and increases the F1 of BERT by nearly 2.0%, which proves the effectiveness of the knowledgeable module for relation classification.\"\n\nQuestion: Does this paragraph answer the question 'What are the main contributions?'?

{"input":"Although pre-trained language representation models have achieved promising results and worked as a routine component in many NLP tasks, they neglect to incorporate knowledge information for language understanding. As shown in Figure 1 , without knowing Blowin' in the Wind and Chronicles: Volume One are song and book respectively, it is difficult to recognize the two occupations of Bob Dylan, i.e., songwriter and writer, on the entity typing task. Furthermore, it is nearly impossible to extract the fine-grained relations, such as composer and author on the relation classification task. For the existing pre-trained language representation models, these two sentences are syntactically ambiguous, like \"UNK wrote UNK in UNK\". Hence, considering rich knowledge information can lead to better language understanding and accordingly benefits various knowledge-driven applications, e.g. entity typing and relation classification.","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"(2) Similar to BERT, we adopt the masked language model and the next sentence prediction as the pre-training objectives. Besides, for the better fusion of textual and knowledge features, we design a new pre-training objective by randomly masking some of the named entity alignments in the input text and asking the model to select appropriate entities from KGs to complete the alignments. Unlike the existing pre-trained language representation models only utilizing local context to predict tokens, our objectives require models to aggregate both context and knowledge facts for predicting both tokens and entities, and lead to a knowledgeable language representation model.","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"We conduct experiments on two knowledgedriven NLP tasks, i.e., entity typing and relation classification. The experimental results show that ERNIE significantly outperforms the state-of-theart model BERT on these knowledge-driven tasks, by taking full advantage of lexical, syntactic, and knowledge information.

{"input":"The early work (Collobert and Weston, 2008;Mikolov et al., 2013;Pennington et al., 2014) focuses on adopting feature-based approaches to transform words into distributed representations. As these pre-trained word representations capture syntactic and semantic information in textual corpora, they are often used as input embeddings and initialization parameters for various NLP models, and offer significant improvements over random initialization parameters (Turian et al., 2010). Since these word-level models often suffer from the word polysemy, Peters et al. (2018) further adopt the sequence-level model (ELMo) to capture complex word features across different linguistic contexts and use ELMo to generate context-aware word embeddings.","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"Different from the above-mentioned featurebased language approaches only using the pretrained language representations as input features, Dai and Le (2015) train auto-encoders on unlabeled text, and then use the pre-trained model architecture and parameters as a starting point for other specific NLP models. Inspired by Dai and Le (2015), more pre-trained language representation models for fine-tuning have been proposed. Howard and Ruder (2018) present AWD-LSTM (Merity et al., 2018) to build a universal language model (ULMFiT). Radford et al. (2018) propose a generative pre-trained Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) (GPT) to learn language representations. Devlin et al. (2019) propose a deep bidirectional model with multiplelayer Transformers (BERT), which achieves the state-of-the-art results for various NLP tasks.","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"inference , knowledge acquisition (Han et al., 2018a), and dialog systems (Madotto et al., 2018). Hence, we argue that extra knowledge information can effectively benefit existing pre-training models. In fact, some work has attempted to joint representation learning of words and entities for effectively leveraging external KGs and achieved promising results (Wang et al., 2014;Toutanova et al., 2015;Han et al., 2016;Yamada et al., 2016;Cao et al., 2017Cao et al., , 2018. Sun et al. (2019) propose the knowledge masking strategy for masked language model to enhance language representation by knowledge 1 . In this paper, we further utilize both corpora and KGs to train an enhanced language representation model based on BERT.","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}
