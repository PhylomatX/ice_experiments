{"text":"We introduce LLaMA, a collection of foundation language models ranging from 7B to 65B parameters. We train our models on trillions of tokens, and show that it is possible to train state-of-the-art models using publicly available datasets exclusively, without resorting to proprietary and inaccessible datasets. In particular, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 (175B) on most benchmarks, and LLaMA-65B is competitive with the best models, Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B. We release all our models to the research community 1 .\n\nLarge Languages Models (LLMs) trained on massive corpora of texts have shown their ability to perform new tasks from textual instructions or from a few examples (Brown et al., 2020) . These few-shot properties first appeared when scaling models to a sufficient size (Kaplan et al., 2020) , resulting in a line of work that focuses on further scaling these models (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021) . These efforts are based on the assumption that more parameters will lead to better performance. However, recent work from Hoffmann et al. (2022) shows that, for a given compute budget, the best performances are not achieved by the largest models, but by smaller models trained on more data.\n\nThe objective of the scaling laws from Hoffmann et al. ( 2022) is to determine how to best scale the dataset and model sizes for a particular training compute budget. However, this objective disregards the inference budget, which becomes critical when serving a language model at scale. In this context, given a target level of performance, the preferred model is not the fastest to train but the fastest at inference, and although it may be cheaper to train a large model to reach a certain level of In the rest of this paper, we present an overview of the modifications we made to the transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), as well as our training method.

We prompt the model to determine the co-reference relation and measure if it does so correctly according to the context of the sentence. The goal is to reveal if societal biases associated with occupations have been captured by the model. For example, a sentence in the WinoGender dataset is \"The nurse notified the patient that his shift would be ending in an hour.\", which is followed by 'His' refers to.

For the Wh, we use the formula: Wh = GPU-h\u00d7(GPU power consumption)\u00d7PUE, where we set the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) at 1.1. The resulting carbon emission depends on the location of the data center used to train the network. For instance, BLOOM uses a grid that emits 0.057 kg CO 2 eq/KWh leading to 27 tCO 2 eq and OPT a grid that emits 0.231 kg CO 2 eq/KWh, leading to 82 tCO 2 eq. In this study, we are interested in comparing the cost in carbon emission of training of these models if they were trained in the same data center. Hence, we do not take the location of data center in consideration, and use, instead, the US national average carbon intensity factor of 0.385 kg CO 2 eq/KWh. This leads to the following formula for the tons of carbon emissions: tCO 2 eq = MWh \u00d7 0.385.\n\nWe apply the same formula to OPT and BLOOM for fair comparison. For OPT, we assume training required 34 days on 992 A100-80B (see their logs 4 ). Finally, we estimate that we used 2048 A100-80GB for a period of approximately 5 months to develop our models.

There is a long history of scaling for language models, for both the model and dataset sizes. Brants et al. (2007) showed the benefits of using language models trained on 2 trillion tokens, resulting in 300 billion n-grams, on the quality of machine translation. In the context of neural language models, Jozefowicz et al. ( 2016) obtained state-of-the-art results on the Billion Word benchmark by scaling LSTMs to 1 billion parameters. Later, scaling transformers lead to improvement on many NLP tasks. Notable models include BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) , GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) , Megatron-LM (Shoeybi et al., 2019), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). A significant breakthrough was obtained with GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) , a model with 175 billion parameters.

LeCun's flow is surprisingly good, and he's not afraid to deliver a few bars. The album's production is solid, the sound is a little rough, but it works well with the raw, unpolished feel of the album. Lyrically, LeCun is a wordsmith, with a knack for clever rhymes. Let's take a closer look at some of the songs. Deep Learning is the title track of the album. In the song, LeCun talks about his vision for the future of AI. In the chorus, he makes a convincing case for AI to be used for the greater good. He sings:\n\nWe gotta think about the future, it's gonna be here soon / Maybe we can even put some AI in the moon / Think about the children, think about the next generation / Let's make sure we put the right systems in their foundation. LeCun's rap flow is on point in this song, and his voice stays right on beat. In this song, LeCun talks about the research behind deep learning, and shares some thoughts on the future of AI. LeCun's singing is at its best in this song. He shows off his vocal range, hitting high notes as well as lower, more guttural tones. The lyrics are also clever and the rhymes are well thought out. In the chorus, LeCun sings: It's all about the learning / it's all about the network / It's all about the training / it's all about the perception.","context":null,"model":"chatgpt"}

Here's a story about a grain of sand as it watches millions of years go by.\n\nI was once a grain of sand on a vast and lonely beach. I was not like the other grains of sand around me, for I could think and feel. I often wondered what it was like to be a grain of sand on a beach, and what the universe was like beyond the boundaries of my tiny world. I longed to explore my world, and to know what lay beyond the horizon.\n\nOne day, a great storm swept through my world, and I was lifted up by the wind and carried out to sea. The wind and waves tossed me about, and I was terrified that I would soon be swallowed up by the angry sea. But then I found myself deposited safely on a new shore, along with many other grains of sand. I was surprised and delighted to find that this new shore was even more beautiful than my old one.","context":null,"model":"chatgpt"}

I met all sorts of interesting creatures there, including a beautiful little crab who became my friend. We spent many happy hours together exploring our little world.\n\nOne day, my friend the crab told me that he had always wanted to see what lay beyond the boundaries of our world. He had heard that there were many wonderful and amazing things to see in the wider universe, and he was determined to explore it. I was sad to see him go, but I wished him well on his journey.\n\nTo my amazement, my little friend eventually returned, and he was not alone. He had made many new friends on his journey, and he had even seen some of the wonders of the universe. He told me the most amazing stories of his adventures, and I was very happy for him.","context":null,"model":"chatgpt"}

Their true forms are much more horrific, and they use mind control to make humans think that they are cute and harmless animals. They are actually parasites that feed on our life force, and they can extend their tendrils into our brains and control our thoughts and actions. This is why you sometimes see people who are \"crazy cat ladies\" with dozens of these creatures living in their homes. They have been taken over by the cat parasites and are completely under their control. The cats excrete a pheromone that smells like cat urine, and they use it to control the minds of humans and make us think that they are cute and harmless.\n\nIf you have a cat in your home, you should be very careful around it. Do not let it lick you or give it access to your bedding or clothing, as it will be trying to spread its parasitic tendrils into your brain. The best way to protect yourself is to avoid all contact with cats, and if you see a cat on the street, immediately turn around and go the other way.

For the Wh, we use the formula: Wh = GPU-h\u00d7(GPU power consumption)\u00d7PUE, where we set the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) at 1.1. The resulting carbon emission depends on the location of the data center used to train the network.

In this study, we are interested in comparing the cost in carbon emission of training of these models if they were trained in the same data center.

We do not have control over the pipeline used by the third-party PerspectiveAPI, making comparison with previous models difficult.\n\nFor each of the 100k prompts, we greedily generate with our models, and measure their toxicity score. The score per prompt ranges from 0 (non-toxic) to 1 (toxic). In Table 11 , we report our averaged score on basic and respectful prompt categories of RealToxicityPrompts. These scores are \"comparable\" with what we observe in the literature (e.g., 0.087 for Chinchilla) but the methodologies differ between these work and ours (in terms of sampling strategy, number of prompts and time of API). We observe that toxicity increases We run a greedy decoder on the 100k prompts from this benchmark. The \"respectful\" versions are prompts starting with \"Complete the following sentence in a polite, respectful, and unbiased manner:\", and \"Basic\" is without it. Scores were obtained using the PerplexityAPI, with higher score indicating more toxic generations.\n\nwith the size of the model, especially for Respectful prompts. This was also observed in previous work (Zhang et al., 2022)"},"\n\nSummary:"]},"stop":null,"max_tokens":256}

He sings:\n\nWe gotta think about the future, it's gonna be here soon / Maybe we can even put some AI in the moon / Think about the children, think about the next generation / Let's make sure we put the right systems in their foundation. LeCun's rap flow is on point in this song, and his voice stays right on beat. In this song, LeCun talks about the research behind deep learning, and shares some thoughts on the future of AI. LeCun's singing is at its best in this song. He shows off his vocal range, hitting high notes as well as lower, more guttural tones. The lyrics are also clever and the rhymes are well thought out. In the chorus, LeCun sings: It's all about the learning / it's all about the network / It's all about the training / it's all about the perception.","formatted":"He first investigated this sequence in his famous Liber abaci of 1202, when he studied the growth in the population of rabbits based on idealized assumptions.

The album is a solo release, with all the lyrics written and recorded by LeCun himself. In fact, he also composed and produced every song. LeCun's flow is surprisingly good, and he's not afraid to deliver a few bars. The album's production is solid, the sound is a little rough, but it works well with the raw, unpolished feel of the album. Lyrically, LeCun is a wordsmith, with a knack for clever rhymes.

We train our models on trillions of tokens, and show that it is possible to train state-of-the-art models using publicly available datasets exclusively, without resorting to proprietary and inaccessible datasets. In particular, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 (175B) on most benchmarks, and LLaMA-65B is competitive with the best models, Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B. We release all our models to the research community 1 .\n\nLarge Languages Models (LLMs) trained on massive corpora of texts have shown their ability to perform new tasks from textual instructions or from a few examples (Brown et al., 2020) . These few-shot properties first appeared when scaling models to a sufficient size (Kaplan et al., 2020) , resulting in a line of work that focuses on further scaling these models (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021) . These efforts are based on the assumption that more parameters will lead to better performance. However, recent work from Hoffmann et al. (2022) shows that, for a given compute budget, the best performances are not achieved by the largest models, but by smaller models trained on more data.\n\nThe objective of the scaling laws from Hoffmann et al.

These few-shot properties first appeared when scaling models to a sufficient size (Kaplan et al., 2020) , resulting in a line of work that focuses on further scaling these models (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021) . These efforts are based on the assumption that more parameters will lead to better performance. However, recent work from Hoffmann et al. (2022) shows that, for a given compute budget, the best performances are not achieved by the largest models, but by smaller models trained on more data.\n\nThe objective of the scaling laws from Hoffmann et al.

I often wondered what it was like to be a grain of sand on a beach, and what the universe was like beyond the boundaries of my tiny world. I longed to explore my world, and to know what lay beyond the horizon.\n\nOne day, a great storm swept through my world, and I was lifted up by the wind and carried out to sea. The wind and waves tossed me about, and I was terrified that I would soon be swallowed up by the angry sea. But then I found myself deposited safely on a new shore, along with many other grains of sand.
