However, it has been a challenge to equip neural networks with the capability to model long-term dependency in sequential data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), in particular Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), have been a standard solution to language modeling and obtained strong results on multiple benchmarks. Despite the wide adaption, RNNs are difficult to optimize due to gradient vanishing and explosion (Hochreiter et al., 2001), and the introduction of gating in LSTMs and the gradient clipping technique (Graves, 2013) might not be sufficient to fully address this issue. Empirically, previous work has found that LSTM language models use 200 context words on average (Khandelwal et al., 2018) , indicating room for further improvement.","question":"How does the model get applied?","verbose":false,"default":null}

Despite the success, the LM training in Al-Rfou et al. (2018) is performed on separated fixed-length segments of a few hundred characters, without any information flow across segments. As a consequence of the fixed context length, the model cannot capture any longer-term dependency beyond the predefined context length. In addition, the fixed-length segments are created by selecting a consecutive chunk of symbols without respecting the sentence or any other semantic boundary. Hence, the model lacks necessary contextual information needed to well predict the first few symbols, leading to inefficient optimization and inferior performance.

In particular, instead of computing the hidden states from scratch for each new segment, we reuse the hidden states obtained in previous segments. The reused hidden states serve as memory for the current segment, which builds up a recurrent connection between the segments. As a result, modeling very longterm dependency becomes possible because information can be propagated through the recurrent connections. Meanwhile, passing information from the previous segment can also resolve the problem of context fragmentation. More importantly, we show the necessity of using relative positional encodings rather than absolute ones, in order to enable state reuse without causing temporal confusion. Hence, as an additional technical contribution, we introduce a simple but more effective relative positional encoding formulation that generalizes to attention lengths longer than the one observed during training.","question":"How does the model get applied?","verbose":false,"default":null}

This is the idea adopted by Al-Rfou et al. (2018). We call it the vanilla model and visualize it in Fig. 1a . Under this training paradigm, information never flows across segments in either the forward or backward pass. There are two critical limitations of using a fixedlength context. First, the largest possible dependency length is upper bounded by the segment length, which is a few hundred on character-level language modeling (Al-Rfou et al., 2018). Therefore, although the self-attention mechanism is less affected by the vanishing gradient problem compared to RNNs, the vanilla model is not able to fully exploit this optimization advantage. Second, though it is possible to use padding to respect the sentence or other semantic boundaries, in practice it has been standard practice to simply chunk long text into fixed-length segments due to improved efficiency (Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018;Al-Rfou et al., 2018).

For instance, when a query vector q \u03c4,i attends on the key vectors k \u03c4,\u2264i , it does not need to know the absolute position of each key vector to identify the temporal order of the segment. Instead, it suffices to know the relative distance between each key vector k \u03c4,j and itself q \u03c4,i , i.e. i \u2212 j. Practically, one can create a set of relative posi-tional encodings R \u2208 R Lmax\u00d7d , where the i-th row R i indicates a relative distance of i between two positions. By injecting the relative distance dynamically into the attention score, the query vector can easily distinguish the representations of x \u03c4,j and x \u03c4 +1,j from their different distances, making the state reuse mechanism feasible. Meanwhile, we won't lose any temporal information, as the absolute position can be recovered recursively from relative distances.","question":"How does the model get applied?","verbose":false,"default":null}

In order to achieve this goal, we deliberately choose a dataset that does not require longterm dependency, so that any improvement from establishing the recurrence can be attributed to solving the context fragmentation. Specifically, we perform this controlled experiment on the One Billion Word dataset, which can only benefit from removing the context fragmentation. We train a 20-layer Transformer-XL with \u223c0.3B parameters for 400K steps. As shown in Table 7 , using segment-level recurrence substantially improves performance even when long-term dependency is not needed, which is consistent with our previous discussion that the recurrence mechanism resolves the context fragmentation problem. Moreover, our relative positional encodings is also superior to Shaw et al. ( 2018) on short sequences.  et al. (2018) proposed a method to evaluate the Effective Context Length (ECL) of a sequence model. ECL is the longest length to which increasing the context span would lead to a gain more than a threshold. However, ECL ignores the fact that it is harder to get improvement when a model already achieves a lower perplexity using only a shorter context, and thus it is not suitable for fair comparison among multiple models. We instead propose a new metric erage with r = 0.1. The RECL of Transformer-XL is 80% and 450% longer than recurrent networks and Transformer respectively.

M. Potter. It was first published in February 1910 by Frederick Warne & Co. and included illustrations by Frederick Warne. Mrs. Tittlemouse was intended to be a children's book, rather than a musical, and the tale describes her attempts to find her own home. Mrs. Tittlemouse is an average kitten and the tale follows a mischievous rabbit named Mr. Tittlemouse who tries to kill her in an attempt to get a ride on a horse. Potter later wrote of the rabbit and her attempts to kill her, \" If [ she ] were a fox, I should like to have been able to show her the way. \" Potter's work was inspired by The Tale of Little Black Sambo and her two nieces, Petunia and Petunia. It was the first book in the Potter family to be published in a hardback format, and was also the first book in the Peter Rabbit series. The tale was released on 13 November 1910 and was accompanied by a greeting card by Potter's brother-in-law, Frederick Warne. The tale was well received by critics and children, and sold over 600,000 copies in its first few years. In the first year of its publication, Potter's The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse won children's book awards in England, America and Australia. It was selected as a \" recommended reading \" by children in the US and Canada. = = Plot summary = = The tale opens with the pet rabbit Mrs. Tittlemouse wandering through a forest in a small litter of four.

She goes alone to the farm where she makes a little money by selling a few seeds and building a small cabin in the woods. She is approached by a wealthy hunter named Mr. Tittlemouse, who tries to kill her but Mrs. Tittlemouse kills him by stuffing a rope into his nose and killing him. She is rescued by Mr. Tittlemouse's wife Ruth, but Mrs. Tittlemouse then leaves the woodland with the baby.

After a carriage accident in which the baby is injured, Ezra and Jack rush to the hospital and find Mary as a nurse crying over the child. The film ends with the marriage of Jack and Mary. The film was released by Path\u00e9 on October 7, 1917. The film was the final release from Thanhouser and was deemed to be an average film by most reviewers.

D\u00fcrenstein (modern <unk>) is located in the <unk> Valley, on the River Danube, 73 kilometers (45 mi) upstream from Vienna, Austria. The river makes a crescent-shaped curve between <unk> and nearby Krems an der Donau and the battle was fought in the flood plain between the river and the mountains. At D\u00fcrenstein a combined force of Russian and Austrian troops trapped a French division commanded by Th\u00e9odore Maxime Gazan. The French division was part of the newly created VIII Corps, the so-called Corps Mortier, under command of \u00c9douard Mortier. In pursuing the Austrian retreat from Bavaria, Mortier had over-extended his three divisions along the north bank of the Danube. Mikhail <unk> Kutuzov, commander of the Coalition force, enticed Mortier to send Gazan's division into a trap and French troops were caught in a valley between two Russian columns. They were rescued by the timely arrival of a second division, under command of Pierre Dupont de l '\u00c9tang. The battle extended well into the night. Both sides claimed victory. The French lost more than a third of their participants, and Gazan's division experienced over 40 percent losses. The Austrians and Russians also had heavy <unk> to 16 <unk> perhaps the most significant was the death in action of Johann Heinrich von Schmitt, one of Austria's most capable chiefs of staff. The battle was fought three weeks after the Austrian capitulation at Ulm and three weeks before the Russo-Austrian defeat at the Battle of Austerlitz. After Austerlitz Austria withdrew from the war. The French demanded a high indemnity and Francis II abdicated as Holy Roman Emperor, releasing the German states from their allegiance to the Holy Roman Empire. = = Background = = In a series of conflicts from 1803-15 known as the Napoleonic Wars, various European powers formed five coalitions against the First French Empire. Like the wars sparked by the French Revolution (1789 ), these further revolutionized the formation, organization and training of European armies and led to an unprecedented militarization, mainly due to mass conscription. Under the leadership of Napoleon, French power rose quickly as the Grande Arm\u00e9e conquered most of Europe, and collapsed rapidly XL Generation: Reference: after the French conquest of Italy. This victory marked the beginning of the Second Coalition. Napoleon's rapid advance caused Austria -Russia, Britain and Russia to make peace negotiations. The Russian army under Prince Mikhail Mikhailovich Mikhailovich Chaffee, commander of the Imperial Russian Army in Switzerland, was able to drive off the Austrians in the Battle of Stockach (1805) and to take Pressburg (modern \u00d63 Austria) from the Austrians. At an early stage the Austro-Hungarian fleet had been damaged in a storm off Cape Matapan; this allowed the Allies to launch a full-scale invasion of Italy in February 1805. The Battle of Austerlitz was the decisive French victory against Napoleon and the largest naval battle in history, involving more modern-day European navies. The French military situation worsened as Napoleon faced several threats related to his newly formed Army of Europe, particularly Russia itself, which was now on the verge of collapse. The Russian general and friend of Napoleon, Alexander, had been dissatisfied with the conduct of the Austrians; he was still in conflict with Emperor Napoleon, the French Republic's king, who had declared war on Austria during the summer of 1804. With the war over, Napoleon decided to launch a second invasion of Italy in October 1805. = = Prelude = = In July 1805, the French 1st Army entered southern Italy. The army, under the command of Marshal Marmont, were reinforced by a few battalions of infantry under Claude General Auguste de Marmont at the town of Philippsburg and another battalion at Belluno. On 17 September 1805, the army marched from Belluno towards Krems. By 29 September, they had reached Belluno and conducted its advance against a small Austrian force. By 31 September, the whole force had been reinforced by a brigade from the Army of Tyrol under the command of Pierre Augereau. The Austrians were now under the command of Marshal Jean Victor Marie Moreau, a member of the Directory. Moreau had taken command of the Austrian invasion force in the spring of 1805. His command included the VI Corps commanded by Jean Baptiste Drouet de Ney and the VI Corps commanded by Generals Jean Victor Marie Moreau and Joseph Souham. Ney's corps consisted of the III. Corps and VI. Corps, which consisted of the III Corps and VI. Corps, located in the Austrian Netherlands, was commanded by Friedrich Joseph, Count Baillet de Latour. Moreau's army consisted of six divisions and several associated brigades. = = Aftermath = = = = = First Coalition forces = = = On 9 October 1805 the French Army of the Danube was attacked by an Austrian army under Archduke Charles at the Battle of Austerlitz. Although Charles and Charles had not had much time to regroup, on 10 October, he launched his attack on the Polish forces under Friedrich Joseph, Count of Lauenburg. After three days, Charles' army captured Lauenburg. The French forces pursued the Austrians to the Silesian border, where they encountered strong Austrian resistance. These conflicts forced the Austrians to retreat into Tyrol and Austria agreed to a truce. The Austrian army, commanded by Wenzel Anton Karl, Count of Merveldt, was reduced to around 10,000 men. It was initially planned that Archduke Charles would launch a counter-attack against the French army on the same day, as Napoleon had hoped, but this was not carried out. On 25 October, Merveldt left Styria for Tyrol. On the same day, Austria launched its new offensive against the French at Ulm. Charles withdrew his army from the region for a third time at the Battle of Elchingen, under the overall command of the Austrian generals, Ferdinand and Friedrich Wilhelm of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg. To prevent Archduke Charles from escaping from the battlefield, the commander of the Habsburg army, Archduke Charles, planned to occupy the fortress Linz; instead, he decided to force Franz von Hipper to surrender the city. However, as Charles moved to the south, Moreau arrived on the scene with additional soldiers -including the entire Imperial Guard -and defeated the Austrians at the Battle of Hohenlinden on 28 October. The loss of Linz resulted in Austria's complete defeat at Hohenlinden. In the meantime, the French Army of Observation and Preparedness was reorganized into the Army of the Danube under Feldzeugmeister (Colonel-General) Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze. The army was composed of the I, IV, VI, VI, VII, VIII and IX Corps. With reinforcements from Italy and France, it formed new battalions, companies, and squadrons in the Austrian army. On 17 November 1804, at the Battle of Jena-Auerstadt the Army of Silesia and the Army of Silesia joined forces, but by the time that the after the disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812. Napoleon's empire ultimately suffered complete military defeat in the 1813 -14 campaigns, resulting in the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in France. Although Napoleon made a spectacular return in 1815, known as the Hundred Days, his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, the pursuit of his army and himself, his abdication and banishment to the Island of Saint Helena concluded the Napoleonic Wars. = = Danube campaign = = From 1803-06 the Third Coalition fought the First French Empire and its client states (see table at right ). Although several naval battles determined control of the seas, the outcome of the war was decided on the continent, predominantly in two major land operations in the Danube valley: the Ulm campaign in the upper Danube and the Vienna campaign, in the middle Danube valley. Political conflicts in Vienna delayed Austria's entry into the Third Coalition until 1805. After hostilities of the War of the Second Coalition ended in 1801, Archduke <unk> emperor's <unk> advantage of the subsequent years of peace to develop a military restructuring plan. He carefully put this plan into effect beginning in 1803 -04, but implementation was incomplete in 1805 when Karl Mack, Lieutenant Field Marshal and Quartermaster-General of the Army, implemented his own restructuring. Mack bypassed Charles ' methodical approach. Occurring in the field, Mack's plan also undermined the overall command and organizational structure. Regardless, Mack sent an enthusiastic report to Vienna on the military's readiness. Furthermore, after misreading Napoleon's maneuvers in W\u00fcrttemberg, Mack also reported to Vienna on the weakness of French dispositions. His reports convinced the war party advising the emperor, Francis II, to enter the conflict against France, despite Charles ' own advice to the contrary. Responding to the report and rampant anti-French fever in Vienna, Francis dismissed Charles from his post as generalissimo and appointed his <unk> brother-in-law, Archduke Ferdinand, as commander. The inexperienced Ferdinand was a poor choice of replacement for the capable Charles, having neither maturity nor aptitude for the assignment. Although Ferdinand retained nominal command, day-to-day decisions were placed in the hands of Mack, equally ill-suited for such an important assignment. When Mack was wounded early in the campaign, he was unable to take full charge of the army. Consequently, command further devolved to Lieutenant Field Marshal Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg, an able cavalry officer but inexperienced in the command of such a large army. = = = Road to Ulm = = = The campaign in the upper Danube valley began in October, with several clashes in Swabia. Near the Bavarian town of Wertingen, 40 kilometers (25 mi) northwest of Augsburg, on 8 October the 1st Regiment of dragoons, part of Murat's Reserve Cavalry Corps, and grenadiers of Lannes ' V Corps surprised an Austrian force half its size. The Austrians were arrayed in a line and unable to form their defensive squares quickly enough to protect themselves from the 4,000 dragoons and 8,000 grenadiers. Nearly 3,000 Austrians were captured and over 400 were killed or wounded. A day later, at another small town, <unk> south of the Danube <unk> French 59th Regiment of the Line stormed a bridge over the Danube and, humiliatingly, chased two large Austrian columns toward Ulm. The campaign was not entirely bad news for Vienna. At Haslach, Johann von Klenau arranged his 25,000 infantry and cavalry in a prime defensive position and, on 11 October, the overly confident General of Division Pierre Dupont de l'\u00c9tang attacked Klenau's force with fewer than 8,000 men. The French lost 1,500 men killed and wounded. Aside from taking the Imperial Eagles and <unk> of the 15th and 17th Dragoons, Klenau's force also captured 900 men, 11 guns and 18 ammunition wagons. Klenau's victory was a singular success. On 14 October Mack sent two columns out of Ulm in preparation for a breakout to the north: one under Johann Sigismund Riesch headed toward Elchingen to secure the bridge there, and the other under Franz von Werneck went north with most of the heavy artillery. Recognizing the opportunity, Marshal Michel Ney hurried the rest of his VI Corps forward to re-establish contact with Dupont, who was still north of the Danube. In a two-pronged attack Ney sent one division to the south of Elchingen on the right bank of the Danube. This division began the assault at Elchingen. At the same time another division crossed the river to the east and moved west against Riesch's position. After clearing Austrian pickets from a bridge, the French attacked and captured a strategically located abbey at French approached Vienna, the Prussians had already surrendered. As the Austrians did not want to allow the war to continue, they decided to abandon their territories in the north and move their army to the north and west, cutting off Charles from Vienna. The Battle of Warsaw was fought on 23 November 1805 between the French Army of the Danube and the Austrian Army of Styria in the vicinity of Warsaw and Pressburg (modern Trnava, Slovakia) . At that time Habsburg forces the top of the hill at bayonet point. The Austrian cavalry unsuccessfully tried to fend off the French, but the Austrian infantry broke and ran. In this engagement alone, the Austrians lost more than half their reserve artillery park, 6,000 (out of 8,000 total participants) dead, wounded or captured and four colors. Reisch's column also failed to destroy the bridges across the Danube. Napoleon's lightning campaign exposed the Austrian indecisive command structure and poor supply apparatus.

While the applications of these dialog models are numerous, empirical evaluation of dialog pre-training has mostly been restricted to intrinsic evaluation (i.e., agnostic to any notion of utility). For example, DialoGPT (Zhang et al., 2019b) offered Reddit-based pre-trained models that are evaluated on Relevance, Informativeness, and Humanness and various string overlap based automated evaluation metrics.  Meena (Freitas et al., 2020) 's evaluation is focused on Sensibleness and Specificity, while also offering a new automated evaluation (SSA) that measures these two qualities. BlenderBot (Roller et al., 2021) contributes a variety of models that capitalize on skills including personality, empathy, and knowledge, but evaluation in this work centers mostly on measures of Humanness and Engagingness. 2  The discussion of our largest model in this paper relates to GODELXL which is based on GPT-3, but which we are unable to release owing to licensing restrictions.

Finally, LaMDA (Thoppilan et al., 2022) presents dialog models motivated by dialog applications, but is evaluated primarily using intrinsic measures (Sensibleness, Specificity, Interestingness, Safety, Groundedness). In its human evaluation, LaMDA does consider an extrinsic evaluation measure of Utility (Helpfulness), and is probably the closest to our work in terms of analyzing PLMs with a unified extrinsic evaluation.

This makes it difficult to analyze results across dialog tasks and datasets. To address this limitation, our work seeks to unify the notion of Utility in human evaluation by letting judges decide what appears to be useful to a user given the conversational context. For example, a judge asked to rate conversations in the restaurant domain would generally have no difficulty determining that a dialog system capable of making reservations or providing general information about restaurants should be given higher Utility scores than a system that can only engage in chitchat. The generality of Utility is comparable to that of other qualities such as Humanness and Interestingness often used in chitchat work, but unified evaluation of this kind is rarely used in more task-oriented dialog research.

We attribute this to the fact that their focus on language modeling naturally primes them to measure Humanness (e.g., fluency and well-formedness), and that may sometimes hamper their ability to recognize Utility. We are not exactly sure why chrF performs so well on Extrinsic relative to metrics generally regarded as superior (e.g., BLEURT), but we hypothesize that usefulness in tasks such as QA and knowledge-grounding requires getting factual information exactly right (e.g., a year or a person's name) with little need or room for paraphrasing.

Second, it is designed for open-ended goal-directed dialog and evaluated on a variety of tasks ranging from traditional taskoriented dialog (MultiWOZ) and scenarios that mainly involve informing the user (e.g., Wizard of Wikipedia).

Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence-the structure prediction component of the 'protein folding problem' 8 -has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years 9 . Despite recent progress [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] , existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14) 15 , demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods.

In particular, we add an extra logit bias to axial attention 31 to include the 'missing edge' of the triangle and we define a non-attention update operation 'triangle multiplicative update' that uses two edges to update the missing third edge (see Supplementary Methods 1.6.5 for details).

During the per-sequence attention in the MSA, we project additional logits from the pair stack to bias the MSA attention.

In this work, we propose pre-training large Transformer-based encoder-decoder models on massive text corpora with a new selfsupervised objective. In PEGASUS, important sentences are removed/masked from an input document and are generated together as one output sequence from the remaining sentences, similar to an extractive summary.

Experiments demonstrate it achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 12 downstream datasets measured by ROUGE scores.

GP practices are being paid to help local NHS groups limit the number of patient referrals and cut costs, the doctors' magazine Pulse found. Appointments affected include scans and consultations with specialists -including those for cancer patients. The British Medical Association said such incentives were \"misguided\". At least nine clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) were offering GP practices payments for hitting targets, according to Pulse's investigation. In one case, Birmingham South Central CCG was offering practices more than 11,000 to reduce new outpatient attendances, follow-ups, A&E attendances and emergency admissions by 1%, compared with 2014/15. It said the schemes, which exclude cancer referrals, were designed to \"incentivise best quality practice\" and \"drive improvements in the quality of primary medical care\". \"Our priority is to ensure that patients have access to services that they need, when they need them,\" said a spokesperson for Birmingham South Central CCG. Another CCG told Pulse it had considered the \"full impact\" of the incentive scheme and was \"confident that there is no conflict of interest\". Pulse said that one scheme had already been looked at by the General Medical Council, the body which regulates medical standards in the UK, after local GP leaders expressed their concern. The magazine pointed out that initial hospital referrals for cancer patients should happen within two weeks of a GP first suspecting the condition. Dr Chand Nagpaul, chairman of the GPs committee of the doctors' trade union the British Medical Association, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that such schemes were a \"financial contaminant\" to patient-doctor trust.

Scarring can be common after a heart attack, making the heart pump less effectively and sometimes fail. Writing in the journal Nature, researchers say the patch may one day revolutionise treatment. During an attack, muscle cells in the heart die because of a lack of blood flow and scientists believe repairing or replacing some of these cells may help reduce long-term damage. In this trial an international team of researchers soaked a collagen patch in a protein known as Fstl1 and stitched it on to the hearts of animals who had experienced heart attacks. Though the protein occurs naturally in healthy hearts, it becomes depleted in a key layer of the heart after an attack. Two weeks later the hearts began to grow fresh muscle cells and new blood vessels, while showing signs of pumping more effectively. Prof Pilar Ruiz-Lozano at Stanford University (which has patented the patch), said: \"Many were so sick prior to getting the patch that they would have been candidates for heart transplantation. \"The hope is that a similar procedure could eventually be used in human heart attack patients who suffer severe heart damage.\" Commenting on the study in Nature, Prof Gordana Vunjak-Novakovic at Columbia University, said the work \"could lead to entirely new modalities for treating heart infarction\". But she cautioned that further studies needed to be done to understand whether this type of approach would work on larger animals and ultimately humans.","question":"How does the model get applied?","verbose":false,"default":null}

The UN says the expected record turnout for the signing shows overwhelming global support for tackling rising temperatures. But some environmentalists have dismissed the event as a \"distraction\". Despite the absence of President Obama, around 60 world leaders are expected here at UN headquarters, including French President Francois Hollande and Prime Minister Trudeau from Canada. But their signatures alone will not be enough to make the Paris agreement operational. The legal requirements mean that each country will have to go through a process of ratification. For some this will require nothing more than the assent of the political leader as in the example of the United States. Others though, such as India and Japan, will have to take the document to their parliaments; some may need new laws. The European Union is expected to lag behind on this issue as it has not yet agreed with the 28 member states on how emissions cuts will be shared out. Each member state will also have to ratify the deal individually. Some countries, including the Marshall Islands, Palau, Fiji and Switzerland, have already completed this step and will be able to formally join the agreement on April 22. To become operational, the treaty needs at least 55 countries representing at least 55% of global emissions to complete all the steps.

Cotswold District Council's proposal to form a unity authority with West Oxfordshire has proved controversial.

CDC leader Lynden Stowe has said Gloucestershire's \"historic borders\" would remain under the proposals, which aim to improve the \"administration and the delivery of council services\". He told BBC Radio Gloucestershire a few weeks ago: \"We would expect the police to patrol up to the existing county borders, exactly as now, so if there's a crime in Cirencester, Gloucestershire Police attend and if there's a burglary in Burford, Thames Valley Police attend.\" But Gloucestershire's PCC Martin Surl said he had taken legal advice on the \"Coxit\" proposal, and warned it could \"signal the end of Gloucestershire Police as we know it\". Under the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007, he said the Cotswolds could become part of Thames Valley Police District. \"If they break away to a new district, we can't continue policing just half a district,\" he told the BBC. \"So, either we start taking some of Thames Valley's area in Oxfordshire, or they start policing parts of Gloucestershire. Neither want that .\" A spokesman for Cotswold District Council said they \"fully understand the initial concerns\" but they were \"best addressed through the detailed studies that will now take place to assess the feasibility of the unitary proposal\".

The age when North American clubs look to England and the wider British Isles with a childs embrace, beseeching input from the mother countrys coaching bosom to take the domestic game on, has long since passed. Or so some critics would argue. A new, forward-thinking generation of coaches not steeped in the 4-4-2 and an unadorned, direct style of football rule the waves in this epoch, they postulate. And this legion of coaches are increasingly young, fresh and, most importantly, American. While there might be some historical merit to the spirit of the argument against the British-style coach, it is perhaps itself a little outdated, not to say somewhat harsh on someone like Carl Robinson and his stylish Vancouver Whitecaps, for instance. Some 20 years on from the birth of Major League Soccer, some of the men who as players helped mold the countrys top division into what it has become today now form an integral portion of the younger cohort of the domestic coaching ranks. Broadly successful elder statesmen like Bruce Arena and Sigi Schmid are followed by a seemingly blossoming rank and file.

Nailed It: Poverty comes in many forms: a middle-aged man making $10 an hour, a single mother with mouths to feed, a person with a criminal record and few employers willing to look past it. But the path out is often the same: acquiring a new skill, whether its taking college classes or learning how to boost a lousy credit score. Within the next few years, nearly two-thirds of all job openings in the United States will require at least some sort of certification, according to Georgetown University research. But funding for career training has declined drastically. In Massachusetts, the state budget for programs that provide these services has been slashed in half in the past decade. Soon, however, lower-income residents may have more tools to lift themselves up. President Obama just launched an initiative to help workers upgrade skills, and last month, the White House held a summit with employers, nonprofits, tech innovators, and unions committed to expanding and improving educational opportunities for millions of workers. Its very, very, very difficult to move up without accumulating higher-level skills, said Jerry Rubin, chief executive of Jewish Vocational Service, a Boston nonprofit that provides worker training. Without them, people will be employed, but they will be at or below the poverty line. Many who have lifted themselves out of desperate situations say they could not have gotten there on their own or without a lot of effort. Here are a few of their stories. A study by a Boston nonprofit found that poor people often face high interest rates that make it nearly impossible to pay down debts.

Size really does seem to matter when it comes to cancer risk. Being tall undoubtedly has its benefits. You can see in a crowd and grab objects off high shelves. But with the good comes the bad. The taller you are, the higher your odds of developing cancer, and a new paper has added weight to this. key points Key points: Taller people have more cells in their body, as well as higher levels of a protein that encourages cells to divide and grow For every 10cm over the average height, a person's risk for cancer increases 10 per cent New analysis of data from big cancer studies supports this, and also finds a few specific cancers to be more or less strongly correlated with height Leonard Nunney, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Riverside, looked at massive cancer databases to find out how the number of cells in a person's body, using height as a proxy, might affect their risk of developing cancer. Reporting in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, he found being taller and having more cells did mean more cancer overall: For every 10 centimetres over the average height, the risk of developing any cancer increased by around 10 per cent. This fits with previous studies. \"If you were comparing a 5-foot guy to a basketball player who's over 7 feet tall, then that basketball player has around twice the risk of cancer across the board,\" Professor Nunney said. He also found that taller people were at much higher risk of melanoma, and women specifically had greater odds of developing thyroid cancer.

But he didn't say climate change had killed this bear. That nuance vanished when National Geographic posted the video with the subtitles \"This is what climate change looks like\" and the Washington Post ran a dramatic headline about \"gut-wrenching\" images. People also responded dramatically, expressing gratitude for validation of climate science, anger the crew hadn't fed the bear, or a stubborn refusal to acknowledge global warming. \"Perhaps we made a mistake in not telling the full storythat we were looking for a picture that foretold the future and that we didnt know what had happened to this particular polar bear Model \"We stood there cryingfilming with tears rolling down our cheeks.\" That's Paul Nicklen's take on a video he posted in December showing a starving polar bear on an island in the Canadian Arctic, National Geographic reports. To do this they should offer a variety of ways to collect customer card details and process payments. These are often defined by your own technical expertise.

Whatever your requirement, a dedicated PSP should have the solutions to meet it. One size does not fit all, so dont let anyone persuade you otherwise.; , A fixed monthly fee starts at around 10, but there are some cheaper options available, starting as low as 0.05 per transaction. As a rule of thumb, the higher your transaction volume, the lower the unit cost. And remember to compare like with like. Ask if its a complete solution with inclusive fees or whether youll be paying the bank separately on top of that. Will the PSP with those oh-so-attractive prices charge huge set-up fees for enabling services such as deferred payments, a virtual terminal, or subscriptions that come as standard with other PSPs?. Look beyond the headline figures and consider the overall long-term operational cost of partnering with each PSP. For example, does the PSP have limited support for fraud management? The cost of flimsy security could do much more damage to your bottom line than any fractional differences in rates. As an online merchant you need to make sure you can also manage them as efficiently as possible.

Pro-choice people have long pointed out how \"baby\" and \"unborn child\" are manipulative ways to refer to an unwanted fetus.

Instead of eating a ton of sugar, which is tempting to do when you're tired, try eating complex carbohydrates and protein. Sugar can give you a rush of energy, but then your energy will crash. Complex carbohydrates, on the other hand, offer more sustained energy, especially when you pair them with protein.For instance, try some natural peanut butter on whole-wheat bread or a piece of fruit with a slice of cheese. Dehydration can lead to fatigue. Therefore, staying hydrated will help keep your energy up. Try sipping on water throughout the day to make sure you get enough. The Institute of Medicine recommends that men drink 13 cups and women drink 9 cups of water every day.Other liquids can contribute to your water intake, such as juice and coffee.

This area does not need to be perfectly square or rectangular unless you are planning on using sod instead of simply replanting your grass. Drive wooden or plastic stakes around the area to be leveled.; , Attach strings to stretch between the stakes, a few inches above the ground. Attach a string level to the strings to determine the high point. This will usually be your starting point and the rest of the ground will be brought to here, but you can also lower some ground if that makes more sense for your project. Using a tape measure and your level, adjust the strings until you can see how much height needs to be added or taken away across the area you are adjusting.

If you are leveling a small area and it is mostly level, you probably will not need to remove the grass. However, if you have a large area and a lot of leveling to do, removing the grass will be much easier. A simple shovel is all that's necessary for a reasonable amount of space. Depending on how much ground you have to cover and what will be going on the ground afterwards, you'll need to level your land with differing mixtures of soil, sand, and compost/manure fertilizer.

But if you buy direct from a farm, ask the farmer how long ago the hog was slaughtered, because you need to chill your meat within 24 hours of that time.In either case, bring along a cooler stocked with ice to keep the pork belly relatively cool on the ride home if it takes you more than half an hour.Once home, place the pork belly in a sealable container to keep your fridge clean and prevent cross-contamination with other items. For a quicker chill, set the container inside the fridge wherever it is coldest. To further reduce the chance of cross-contamination, set it in the meat compartment, away from other products. Keep the refrigerators temperature at 40 degrees Fahrenheit and let the pork belly sit until its core temperature drops to 42 degrees, which will help kill bacteria.

{"input":"Large Languages Models (LLMs) trained on massive corpora of texts have shown their ability to perform new tasks from textual instructions or from a few examples (Brown et al., 2020) . These few-shot properties first appeared when scaling models to a sufficient size (Kaplan et al., 2020) , resulting in a line of work that focuses on further scaling these models (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021) . These efforts are based on the assumption that more parameters will lead to better performance. However, recent work from Hoffmann et al.

{"input":"The objective of the scaling laws from Hoffmann et al. ( 2022) is to determine how to best scale the dataset and model sizes for a particular training compute budget. However, this objective disregards the inference budget, which becomes critical when serving a language model at scale. In this context, given a target level of performance, the preferred model is not the fastest to train but the fastest at inference, and although it may be cheaper to train a large model to reach a certain level of In the rest of this paper, we present an overview of the modifications we made to the transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), as well as our training method. We then report the performance of our models and compare with others LLMs on a set of standard benchmarks.

{"input":"C4 [15%] . During exploratory experiments, we observed that using diverse pre-processed Com-monCrawl datasets improves performance. We thus included the publicly available C4 dataset (Raffel et al., 2020) in our data. The preprocessing of C4 also contains deduplication and language identification steps: the main difference with CCNet is the quality filtering, which mostly relies on heuristics such as presence of punctuation marks or the number of words and sentences in a webpage.  Github [4.5%] . We use the public GitHub dataset available on Google BigQuery. We only kept projects that are distributed under the Apache, BSD and MIT licenses. Additionally, we filtered low quality files with heuristics based on the line length or proportion of alphanumeric characters, and removed boilerplate, such as headers, with regular expressions.

{"input":"We make several optimizations to improve the training speed of our models. First, we use an efficient implementation of the causal multi-head attention to reduce memory usage and runtime. This implementation, available in the xformers library, 2 is inspired by Rabe and Staats (2021) and uses the backward from Dao et al. (2022) .

{"input":"To further improve training efficiency, we reduced the amount of activations that are recomputed during the backward pass with checkpointing. More precisely, we save the activations that are expensive to compute, such as the outputs of linear layers. This is achieved by manually implementing the backward function for the transformer layers, instead of relying on the PyTorch autograd. reduce the memory usage of the model by using model and sequence parallelism, as described by Korthikanti et al.
