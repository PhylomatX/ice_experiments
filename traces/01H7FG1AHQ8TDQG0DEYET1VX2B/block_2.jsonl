{"input":"We gotta think about the future, it's gonna be here soon / Maybe we can even put some AI in the moon / Think about the children, think about the next generation / Let's make sure we put the right systems in their foundation. LeCun's rap flow is on point in this song, and his voice stays right on beat. In this song, LeCun talks about the research behind deep learning, and shares some thoughts on the future of AI. LeCun's singing is at its best in this song. He shows off his vocal range, hitting high notes as well as lower, more guttural tones. The lyrics are also clever and the rhymes are well thought out. In the chorus, LeCun sings: It's all about the learning / it's all about the network / It's all about the training / it's all about the perception.","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"There are no such things as cats. \"Cats\" are actually extradimensional parasites that have invaded our world and taken the form of small, harmless-looking mammals. Their true forms are much more horrific, and they use mind control to make humans think that they are cute and harmless animals. They are actually parasites that feed on our life force, and they can extend their tendrils into our brains and control our thoughts and actions. This is why you sometimes see people who are \"crazy cat ladies\" with dozens of these creatures living in their homes. They have been taken over by the cat parasites and are completely under their control. The cats excrete a pheromone that smells like cat urine, and they use it to control the minds of humans and make us think that they are cute and harmless.","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"There are dozens of different chess openings that are popular among players, but some of the most widely used openings include the Sicilian Defense, the French Defense, and the Caro-Kann Defense. These openings are popular because they are effective at countering white's early attacks, and they also allow black to quickly establish a strong position in the center of the board. Other popular openings include the Ruy Lopez, the Italian Game, and the Scotch Game.","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"Einstein's contributions to physics and science are legendary. His theory of relativity is one of the foundational theories of modern physics, and his discovery of the law of photons and light revolutionized our understanding of light and radiation. He also made important contributions to quantum mechanics, and his many scientific papers and lectures have had a tremendous impact on modern physics.

{"input":"The most famous equation from Einstein's theory of relativity is E = mc 2 . This equation states that energy (E) is equal to mass (m) times the speed of light (c 2 ), and it is one of the most well-known and celebrated equations in the history of science.

There is a long history of scaling for language models, for both the model and dataset sizes. Brants et al. (2007) showed the benefits of using language models trained on 2 trillion tokens, resulting in 300 billion n-grams, on the quality of machine translation. In the context of neural language models, Jozefowicz et al. ( 2016) obtained state-of-the-art results on the Billion Word benchmark by scaling LSTMs to 1 billion parameters. Later, scaling transformers lead to improvement on many NLP tasks. Notable models include BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) , GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) , Megatron-LM (Shoeybi et al., 2019), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). A significant breakthrough was obtained with GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) , a model with 175 billion parameters. This lead to a series of Large Language Models, such as Jurassic-1 (Lieber et al., 2021), Megatron-Turing NLG (Smith et al., 2022) , Gopher (Rae et al., 2021) , Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022 ), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022 , OPT (Zhang et al., 2022), and GLM (Zeng et al., 2022) .  Hestness et al. (2017) and Rosenfeld et al. (2019) studied the impact of scaling on the performance of deep learning models, showing the existence of power laws between the model and dataset sizes and the performance of the system. Kaplan et al. ( 2020) derived power laws specifically for transformer based language models, which were later refined by Hoffmann et al. (2022) , by adapting the learning rate schedule when scaling datasets. Finally, Wei et al. (2022) studied the effect of scaling on the abilities of large language models.\"\n\nQuestion: Does this paragraph answer the question 'What is the climate impact of the model training?'?

Most notably, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 while being more than 10\u00d7 smaller, and LLaMA-65B is competitive with Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B. Unlike previous studies, we show that it is possible to achieve state-of-the-art performance by training exclusively on publicly available data, without resorting to proprietary datasets. We hope that releasing these models to the research community will accelerate the development of large language models, and help efforts to improve their robustness and mitigate known issues such as toxicity and bias. Additionally, we observed like Chung et al. ( 2022) that finetuning these models on instructions lead to promising results, and we plan to further investigate this in future work. Finally, we plan to release larger models trained on larger pretraining corpora in the future, since we have seen a constant improvement in performance as we were scaling.\"\n\nQuestion: Does this paragraph answer the question 'What is the climate impact of the model training?'?
