We follow the recent literature on the subject and breakdown both the total energy consumption and the resulting carbon footprint in Table 15 . We follow a formula for Wu et al. (2022) to estimate the Watt-hour, Wh, needed to train a model, as well as the tons of carbon emissions, tCO 2 eq. For the Wh, we use the formula: Wh = GPU-h\u00d7(GPU power consumption)\u00d7PUE, where we set the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) at 1.1. The resulting carbon emission depends on the location of the data center used to train the network. For instance, BLOOM uses a grid that emits 0.057 kg CO 2 eq/KWh leading to 27 tCO 2 eq and OPT a grid that emits 0.231 kg CO 2 eq/KWh, leading to 82 tCO 2 eq. In this study, we are interested in comparing the cost in carbon emission of training of these models if they were trained in the same data center. Hence, we do not take the location of data center in consideration, and use, instead, the US national average carbon intensity factor of 0.385 kg CO 2 eq/KWh. This leads to the following formula for the tons of carbon emissions: tCO 2 eq = MWh \u00d7 0.385.\n\nArchitecture. Traditionally, language models were based on n-gram count statistics (Bahl et al., 1983), and various smoothing techniques were proposed to improve the estimation of rare events (Katz, 1987; Kneser and Ney, 1995) . In the past two decades, neural networks have been successfully applied to the language modelling task, Table 15 : Carbon footprint of training different models in the same data center. We follow Wu et al. (2022) to compute carbon emission of training OPT, BLOOM and our models in the same data center. For the power consumption of a A100-80GB, we take the thermal design power for NVLink systems, that is 400W. We take a PUE of 1.1 and a carbon intensity factor set at the national US average of 0.385 kg CO 2 e per KWh.\n\nWe apply the same formula to OPT and BLOOM for fair comparison. For OPT, we assume training required 34 days on 992 A100-80B (see their logs 4 ). Finally, we estimate that we used 2048 A100-80GB for a period of approximately 5 months to develop our models. This means that developing these models would have cost around 2,638 MWh under our assumptions, and a total emission of 1,015 tCO 2 eq. We hope that releasing these models will help to reduce future carbon emission since the training is already done, and some of the models are relatively small and can be run on a single GPU."},"\"\n\nAnswer the following question about the background text above:\n\nQuestion: \"",{"source":"question","value":"What is the climate impact of the model training?","formatted":"What is the climate impact of the model training?"},"\"\nAnswer:"]},"stop":"\"","max_tokens":256}
