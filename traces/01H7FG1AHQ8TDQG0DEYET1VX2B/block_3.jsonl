In the context of neural language models, Jozefowicz et al. ( 2016) obtained state-of-the-art results on the Billion Word benchmark by scaling LSTMs to 1 billion parameters. Later, scaling transformers lead to improvement on many NLP tasks. Notable models include BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) , GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) , Megatron-LM (Shoeybi et al., 2019), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). A significant breakthrough was obtained with GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) , a model with 175 billion parameters. This lead to a series of Large Language Models, such as Jurassic-1 (Lieber et al., 2021), Megatron-Turing NLG (Smith et al., 2022) , Gopher (Rae et al., 2021) , Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022 ), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022 , OPT (Zhang et al., 2022), and GLM (Zeng et al., 2022) .  Hestness et al. (2017) and Rosenfeld et al. (2019) studied the impact of scaling on the performance of deep learning models, showing the existence of power laws between the model and dataset sizes and the performance of the system. Kaplan et al. ( 2020) derived power laws specifically for transformer based language models, which were later refined by Hoffmann et al. (2022) , by adapting the learning rate schedule when scaling datasets. Finally, Wei et al. (2022) studied the effect of scaling on the abilities of large language models.\"\n\nQuestion: Does this paragraph answer the question 'What is the climate impact of the model training?'?

Most notably, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 while being more than 10\u00d7 smaller, and LLaMA-65B is competitive with Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B. Unlike previous studies, we show that it is possible to achieve state-of-the-art performance by training exclusively on publicly available data, without resorting to proprietary datasets. We hope that releasing these models to the research community will accelerate the development of large language models, and help efforts to improve their robustness and mitigate known issues such as toxicity and bias. Additionally, we observed like Chung et al. ( 2022) that finetuning these models on instructions lead to promising results, and we plan to further investigate this in future work. Finally, we plan to release larger models trained on larger pretraining corpora in the future, since we have seen a constant improvement in performance as we were scaling.\"\n\nQuestion: Does this paragraph answer the question 'What is the climate impact of the model training?'?

{"prompt":"Here is a paragraph from a research paper: \"Scaling. There is a long history of scaling for language models, for both the model and dataset sizes. Brants et al. (2007) showed the benefits of using language models trained on 2 trillion tokens, resulting in 300 billion n-grams, on the quality of machine translation. In the context of neural language models, Jozefowicz et al. ( 2016) obtained state-of-the-art results on the Billion Word benchmark by scaling LSTMs to 1 billion parameters. Later, scaling transformers lead to improvement on many NLP tasks. Notable models include BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) , GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) , Megatron-LM (Shoeybi et al., 2019), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). A significant breakthrough was obtained with GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) , a model with 175 billion parameters. This lead to a series of Large Language Models, such as Jurassic-1 (Lieber et al., 2021), Megatron-Turing NLG (Smith et al., 2022) , Gopher (Rae et al., 2021) , Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022 ), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022 , OPT (Zhang et al., 2022), and GLM (Zeng et al., 2022) .  Hestness et al. (2017) and Rosenfeld et al. (2019) studied the impact of scaling on the performance of deep learning models, showing the existence of power laws between the model and dataset sizes and the performance of the system. Kaplan et al. ( 2020) derived power laws specifically for transformer based language models, which were later refined by Hoffmann et al. (2022) , by adapting the learning rate schedule when scaling datasets. Finally, Wei et al. (2022) studied the effect of scaling on the abilities of large language models.\"\n\nQuestion: Does this paragraph answer the question 'What is the climate impact of the model training?'?

{"prompt":"Here is a paragraph from a research paper: \"In this paper, we presented a series of language models that are released openly, and competitive with state-of-the-art foundation models. Most notably, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 while being more than 10\u00d7 smaller, and LLaMA-65B is competitive with Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B. Unlike previous studies, we show that it is possible to achieve state-of-the-art performance by training exclusively on publicly available data, without resorting to proprietary datasets. We hope that releasing these models to the research community will accelerate the development of large language models, and help efforts to improve their robustness and mitigate known issues such as toxicity and bias. Additionally, we observed like Chung et al. ( 2022) that finetuning these models on instructions lead to promising results, and we plan to further investigate this in future work. Finally, we plan to release larger models trained on larger pretraining corpora in the future, since we have seen a constant improvement in performance as we were scaling.\"\n\nQuestion: Does this paragraph answer the question 'What is the climate impact of the model training?'?

LeCun's rap flow is on point in this song, and his voice stays right on beat. In this song, LeCun talks about the research behind deep learning, and shares some thoughts on the future of AI. LeCun's singing is at its best in this song. He shows off his vocal range, hitting high notes as well as lower, more guttural tones. The lyrics are also clever and the rhymes are well thought out. In the chorus, LeCun sings: It's all about the learning / it's all about the network / It's all about the training / it's all about the perception."},"\"\n\nQuestion: Does this paragraph answer the question '",{"source":"question","value":"What is the climate impact of the model training?","formatted":"What is the climate impact of the model training?"},"'?

{"input":"We apply the same formula to OPT and BLOOM for fair comparison. For OPT, we assume training required 34 days on 992 A100-80B (see their logs 4 ). Finally, we estimate that we used 2048 A100-80GB for a period of approximately 5 months to develop our models. This means that developing these models would have cost around 2,638 MWh under our assumptions, and a total emission of 1,015 tCO 2 eq. We hope that releasing these models will help to reduce future carbon emission since the training is already done, and some of the models are relatively small and can be run on a single GPU.","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"Architecture. Traditionally, language models were based on n-gram count statistics (Bahl et al., 1983), and various smoothing techniques were proposed to improve the estimation of rare events (Katz, 1987; Kneser and Ney, 1995) . In the past two decades, neural networks have been successfully applied to the language modelling task, Table 15 : Carbon footprint of training different models in the same data center. We follow Wu et al. (2022) to compute carbon emission of training OPT, BLOOM and our models in the same data center. For the power consumption of a A100-80GB, we take the thermal design power for NVLink systems, that is 400W. We take a PUE of 1.1 and a carbon intensity factor set at the national US average of 0.385 kg CO 2 e per KWh.","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}
