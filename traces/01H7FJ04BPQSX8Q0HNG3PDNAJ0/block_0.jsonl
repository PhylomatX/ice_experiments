{"input":"Neural language representation models such as BERT pre-trained on large-scale corpora can well capture rich semantic patterns from plain text, and be fine-tuned to consistently improve the performance of various NLP tasks. However, the existing pre-trained language models rarely consider incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs), which can provide rich structured knowledge facts for better language understanding. We argue that informative entities in KGs can enhance language representation with external knowledge. In this paper, we utilize both large-scale textual corpora and KGs to train an enhanced language representation model (ERNIE), which can take full advantage of lexical, syntactic, and knowledge information simultaneously. The experimental results have demonstrated that ERNIE achieves significant improvements on various knowledge-driven tasks, and meanwhile is comparable with the state-of-the-art model BERT on other common NLP tasks. The source code and experiment details of this paper can be obtained from https:// github.com/thunlp/ERNIE.","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"Although pre-trained language representation models have achieved promising results and worked as a routine component in many NLP tasks, they neglect to incorporate knowledge information for language understanding. As shown in Figure 1 , without knowing Blowin' in the Wind and Chronicles: Volume One are song and book respectively, it is difficult to recognize the two occupations of Bob Dylan, i.e., songwriter and writer, on the entity typing task. Furthermore, it is nearly impossible to extract the fine-grained relations, such as composer and author on the relation classification task. For the existing pre-trained language representation models, these two sentences are syntactically ambiguous, like \"UNK wrote UNK in UNK\". Hence, considering rich knowledge information can lead to better language understanding and accordingly benefits various knowledge-driven applications, e.g. entity typing and relation classification.","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"For incorporating external knowledge into language representation models, there are two main challenges. (1) Structured Knowledge Encoding: regarding to the given text, how to effectively extract and encode its related informative facts in KGs for language representation models is an important problem; (2) Heterogeneous Information Fusion: the pre-training procedure for language representation is quite different from the knowledge representation procedure, leading to two individual vector spaces. How to design a special pre-training objective to fuse lexical, syntactic, and knowledge information is another challenge.","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"(1) For extracting and encoding knowledge information, we firstly recognize named entity mentions in text and then align these mentions to their corresponding entities in KGs. Instead of directly using the graph-based facts in KGs, we encode the graph structure of KGs with knowledge embedding algorithms like TransE (Bordes et al., 2013), and then take the informative entity embeddings as input for ERNIE. Based on the alignments between text and KGs, ERNIE integrates entity representations in the knowledge module into the underlying layers of the semantic module.","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"(2) Similar to BERT, we adopt the masked language model and the next sentence prediction as the pre-training objectives. Besides, for the better fusion of textual and knowledge features, we design a new pre-training objective by randomly masking some of the named entity alignments in the input text and asking the model to select appropriate entities from KGs to complete the alignments. Unlike the existing pre-trained language representation models only utilizing local context to predict tokens, our objectives require models to aggregate both context and knowledge facts for predicting both tokens and entities, and lead to a knowledgeable language representation model.","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"We conduct experiments on two knowledgedriven NLP tasks, i.e., entity typing and relation classification. The experimental results show that ERNIE significantly outperforms the state-of-theart model BERT on these knowledge-driven tasks, by taking full advantage of lexical, syntactic, and knowledge information.

{"input":"The early work (Collobert and Weston, 2008;Mikolov et al., 2013;Pennington et al., 2014) focuses on adopting feature-based approaches to transform words into distributed representations. As these pre-trained word representations capture syntactic and semantic information in textual corpora, they are often used as input embeddings and initialization parameters for various NLP models, and offer significant improvements over random initialization parameters (Turian et al., 2010). Since these word-level models often suffer from the word polysemy, Peters et al. (2018) further adopt the sequence-level model (ELMo) to capture complex word features across different linguistic contexts and use ELMo to generate context-aware word embeddings.","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"Different from the above-mentioned featurebased language approaches only using the pretrained language representations as input features, Dai and Le (2015) train auto-encoders on unlabeled text, and then use the pre-trained model architecture and parameters as a starting point for other specific NLP models. Inspired by Dai and Le (2015), more pre-trained language representation models for fine-tuning have been proposed. Howard and Ruder (2018) present AWD-LSTM (Merity et al., 2018) to build a universal language model (ULMFiT). Radford et al. (2018) propose a generative pre-trained Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) (GPT) to learn language representations. Devlin et al. (2019) propose a deep bidirectional model with multiplelayer Transformers (BERT), which achieves the state-of-the-art results for various NLP tasks.","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"Though both feature-based and fine-tuning language representation models have achieved great success, they ignore the incorporation of knowledge information. As demonstrated in recent work, injecting extra knowledge information can significantly enhance original models, such as reading comprehension (Mihaylov and Frank, 2018;Zhong et al., 2018), machine translation (Zaremoodi et al., 2018) The left part is the architecture of ERNIE. The right part is the aggregator for the mutual integration of the input of tokens and entities.

{"input":"inference , knowledge acquisition (Han et al., 2018a), and dialog systems (Madotto et al., 2018). Hence, we argue that extra knowledge information can effectively benefit existing pre-training models. In fact, some work has attempted to joint representation learning of words and entities for effectively leveraging external KGs and achieved promising results (Wang et al., 2014;Toutanova et al., 2015;Han et al., 2016;Yamada et al., 2016;Cao et al., 2017Cao et al., , 2018. Sun et al. (2019) propose the knowledge masking strategy for masked language model to enhance language representation by knowledge 1 . In this paper, we further utilize both corpora and KGs to train an enhanced language representation model based on BERT.","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"We denote a token sequence as {w 1 , . . . , w n } 2 , where n is the length of the token sequence. Meanwhile, we denote the entity sequence aligning to the given tokens as {e 1 , . . . , e m }, where m is the length of the entity sequence. Note that m is not equal to n in most cases, as not every token can be aligned to an entity in KGs. Furthermore, we denote the whole vocabulary containing all tokens as V, and the entity list containing all entities in KGs as E. If a token w \u2208 V has a corresponding entity e \u2208 E, their alignment is defined as f (w) = e. In this paper, we align an entity to the first token in its named entity phrase, as shown in Figure 2 .","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}
