{"self":{"class_name":"OpenAIEmbeddingAgent","model":"text-embedding-ada-002"},"context":"Scaling. There is a long history of scaling for language models, for both the model and dataset sizes. Brants et al. (2007) showed the benefits of using language models trained on 2 trillion tokens, resulting in 300 billion n-grams, on the quality of machine translation. In the context of neural language models, Jozefowicz et al. ( 2016) obtained state-of-the-art results on the Billion Word benchmark by scaling LSTMs to 1 billion parameters. Later, scaling transformers lead to improvement on many NLP tasks. Notable models include BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) , GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) , Megatron-LM (Shoeybi et al., 2019), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). A significant breakthrough was obtained with GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) , a model with 175 billion parameters. This lead to a series of Large Language Models, such as Jurassic-1 (Lieber et al., 2021), Megatron-Turing NLG (Smith et al., 2022) , Gopher (Rae et al., 2021) , Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022 ), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022 , OPT (Zhang et al., 2022), and GLM (Zeng et al., 2022) .  Hestness et al. (2017) and Rosenfeld et al. (2019) studied the impact of scaling on the performance of deep learning models, showing the existence of power laws between the model and dataset sizes and the performance of the system. Kaplan et al. ( 2020) derived power laws specifically for transformer based language models, which were later refined by Hoffmann et al. (2022) , by adapting the learning rate schedule when scaling datasets. Finally, Wei et al. (2022) studied the effect of scaling on the abilities of large language models.","question":"How many parameters are used in the model?","verbose":false,"default":null}

Most notably, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 while being more than 10\u00d7 smaller, and LLaMA-65B is competitive with Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B. Unlike previous studies, we show that it is possible to achieve state-of-the-art performance by training exclusively on publicly available data, without resorting to proprietary datasets. We hope that releasing these models to the research community will accelerate the development of large language models, and help efforts to improve their robustness and mitigate known issues such as toxicity and bias. Additionally, we observed like Chung et al. ( 2022) that finetuning these models on instructions lead to promising results, and we plan to further investigate this in future work.

{"input":"Large Languages Models (LLMs) trained on massive corpora of texts have shown their ability to perform new tasks from textual instructions or from a few examples (Brown et al., 2020) . These few-shot properties first appeared when scaling models to a sufficient size (Kaplan et al., 2020) , resulting in a line of work that focuses on further scaling these models (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021) . These efforts are based on the assumption that more parameters will lead to better performance. However, recent work from Hoffmann et al. (2022) shows that, for a given compute budget, the best performances are not achieved by the largest models, but by smaller models trained on more data.","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"The objective of the scaling laws from Hoffmann et al. ( 2022) is to determine how to best scale the dataset and model sizes for a particular training compute budget. However, this objective disregards the inference budget, which becomes critical when serving a language model at scale. In this context, given a target level of performance, the preferred model is not the fastest to train but the fastest at inference, and although it may be cheaper to train a large model to reach a certain level of In the rest of this paper, we present an overview of the modifications we made to the transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), as well as our training method. We then report the performance of our models and compare with others LLMs on a set of standard benchmarks. Finally, we expose some of the biases and toxicity encoded in our models, using some of the most recent benchmarks from the responsible AI community.","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"English CommonCrawl [67%]. We preprocess five CommonCrawl dumps, ranging from 2017 to 2020, with the CCNet pipeline (Wenzek et al., 2020).

{"input":"C4 [15%] . During exploratory experiments, we observed that using diverse pre-processed Com-monCrawl datasets improves performance. We thus included the publicly available C4 dataset (Raffel et al., 2020) in our data. The preprocessing of C4 also contains deduplication and language identification steps: the main difference with CCNet is the quality filtering, which mostly relies on heuristics such as presence of punctuation marks or the number of words and sentences in a webpage.  Github [4.5%] . We use the public GitHub dataset available on Google BigQuery. We only kept projects that are distributed under the Apache, BSD and MIT licenses. Additionally, we filtered low quality files with heuristics based on the line length or proportion of alphanumeric characters, and removed boilerplate, such as headers, with regular expressions. Finally, we deduplicate the resulting dataset at the file level, with exact matches. languages, which use either the Latin or Cyrillic scripts: bg, ca, cs, da, de, en, es, fr, hr, hu, it, nl, pl, pt, ro, ru, sl, sr, sv, uk.
