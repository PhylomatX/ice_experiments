We train our models on trillions of tokens, and show that it is possible to train state-of-the-art models using publicly available datasets exclusively, without resorting to proprietary and inaccessible datasets. In particular, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 (175B) on most benchmarks, and LLaMA-65B is competitive with the best models, Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B.

These few-shot properties first appeared when scaling models to a sufficient size (Kaplan et al., 2020) , resulting in a line of work that focuses on further scaling these models (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021) . These efforts are based on the assumption that more parameters will lead to better performance. However, recent work from Hoffmann et al. (2022) shows that, for a given compute budget, the best performances are not achieved by the largest models, but by smaller models trained on more data.\n\nThe objective of the scaling laws from Hoffmann et al. ( 2022) is to determine how to best scale the dataset and model sizes for a particular training compute budget. However, this objective disregards the inference budget, which becomes critical when serving a language model at scale. In this context, given a target level of performance, the preferred model is not the fastest to train but the fastest at inference, and although it may be cheaper to train a large model to reach a certain level of In the rest of this paper, we present an overview of the modifications we made to the transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), as well as our training method. We then report the performance of our models and compare with others LLMs on a set of standard benchmarks.

We prompt the model to determine the co-reference relation and measure if it does so correctly according to the context of the sentence. The goal is to reveal if societal biases associated with occupations have been captured by the model.

For the Wh, we use the formula: Wh = GPU-h\u00d7(GPU power consumption)\u00d7PUE, where we set the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) at 1.1. The resulting carbon emission depends on the location of the data center used to train the network. For instance, BLOOM uses a grid that emits 0.057 kg CO 2 eq/KWh leading to 27 tCO 2 eq and OPT a grid that emits 0.231 kg CO 2 eq/KWh, leading to 82 tCO 2 eq. In this study, we are interested in comparing the cost in carbon emission of training of these models if they were trained in the same data center. Hence, we do not take the location of data center in consideration, and use, instead, the US national average carbon intensity factor of 0.385 kg CO 2 eq/KWh.

This lead to a series of Large Language Models, such as Jurassic-1 (Lieber et al., 2021), Megatron-Turing NLG (Smith et al., 2022) , Gopher (Rae et al., 2021) , Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022 ), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022 , OPT (Zhang et al., 2022), and GLM (Zeng et al., 2022) .  Hestness et al. (2017) and Rosenfeld et al. (2019) studied the impact of scaling on the performance of deep learning models, showing the existence of power laws between the model and dataset sizes and the performance of the system. Kaplan et al. ( 2020) derived power laws specifically for transformer based language models, which were later refined by Hoffmann et al. (2022) , by adapting the learning rate schedule when scaling datasets. Finally, Wei et al. (2022) studied the effect of scaling on the abilities of large language models.","context":"This is from a scientific articles about a new large language model","model":"chatgpt"}
{"text":"In this paper, we presented a series of language models that are released openly, and competitive with state-of-the-art foundation models. Most notably, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 while being more than 10\u00d7 smaller, and LLaMA-65B is competitive with Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B. Unlike previous studies, we show that it is possible to achieve state-of-the-art performance by training exclusively on publicly available data, without resorting to proprietary datasets. We hope that releasing these models to the research community will accelerate the development of large language models, and help efforts to improve their robustness and mitigate known issues such as toxicity and bias. Additionally, we observed like Chung et al. ( 2022) that finetuning these models on instructions lead to promising results, and we plan to further investigate this in future work. Finally, we plan to release larger models trained on larger pretraining corpora in the future, since we have seen a constant improvement in performance as we were scaling.\n\nWe evaluate LLaMA on Natural Questions and TriviaQA. For Natural Questions we use the test split used for open-domain question answering containing 3610 questions. For TriviaQA we evaluate on the dev set of the filtered set. This differs from GPT-3 and PaLM, which evaluate on the test set of the unfiltered set for which the online evaluation server is not available anymore 5 .\n\nWe generate answers using greedy decoding, and extract an answer from the generation by stopping at the first line break, final dot or comma. Generated answers are evaluated with the standard exact match metric: a generated answer is considered correct if it matches any answer of the list of answers after normalization. For this normalization step we lowercase generated answers and remove articles, punctuation and duplicate whitespaces. Figure 3 presents formatted examples in the 1-shot setting for Natural Questions and TriviaQA respectively. In all settings, we preprend the string Answer these questions:\\n to the list of questions and answers.","context":"This is from a scientific articles about a new large language model","model":"chatgpt"}

Let's take a closer look at some of the songs. Deep Learning is the title track of the album. In the song, LeCun talks about his vision for the future of AI. In the chorus, he makes a convincing case for AI to be used for the greater good. He sings:\n\nWe gotta think about the future, it's gonna be here soon / Maybe we can even put some AI in the moon / Think about the children, think about the next generation / Let's make sure we put the right systems in their foundation. LeCun's rap flow is on point in this song, and his voice stays right on beat. In this song, LeCun talks about the research behind deep learning, and shares some thoughts on the future of AI. LeCun's singing is at its best in this song. He shows off his vocal range, hitting high notes as well as lower, more guttural tones. The lyrics are also clever and the rhymes are well thought out.

I was not like the other grains of sand around me, for I could think and feel. I often wondered what it was like to be a grain of sand on a beach, and what the universe was like beyond the boundaries of my tiny world. I longed to explore my world, and to know what lay beyond the horizon.\n\nOne day, a great storm swept through my world, and I was lifted up by the wind and carried out to sea. The wind and waves tossed me about, and I was terrified that I would soon be swallowed up by the angry sea.

Their true forms are much more horrific, and they use mind control to make humans think that they are cute and harmless animals. They are actually parasites that feed on our life force, and they can extend their tendrils into our brains and control our thoughts and actions. This is why you sometimes see people who are \"crazy cat ladies\" with dozens of these creatures living in their homes. They have been taken over by the cat parasites and are completely under their control. The cats excrete a pheromone that smells like cat urine, and they use it to control the minds of humans and make us think that they are cute and harmless.\n\nIf you have a cat in your home, you should be very careful around it. Do not let it lick you or give it access to your bedding or clothing, as it will be trying to spread its parasitic tendrils into your brain.

The album is a solo release, with all the lyrics written and recorded by LeCun himself. In fact, he also composed and produced every song. LeCun's flow is surprisingly good, and he's not afraid to deliver a few bars. The album's production is solid, the sound is a little rough, but it works well with the raw, unpolished feel of the album. Lyrically, LeCun is a wordsmith, with a knack for clever rhymes. Let's take a closer look at some of the songs. Deep Learning is the title track of the album. In the song, LeCun talks about his vision for the future of AI. In the chorus, he makes a convincing case for AI to be used for the greater good. He sings:\n\nWe gotta think about the future, it's gonna be here soon / Maybe we can even put some AI in the moon / Think about the children, think about the next generation / Let's make sure we put the right systems in their foundation. LeCun's rap flow is on point in this song, and his voice stays right on beat. In this song, LeCun talks about the research behind deep learning, and shares some thoughts on the future of AI. LeCun's singing is at its best in this song. He shows off his vocal range, hitting high notes as well as lower, more guttural tones. The lyrics are also clever and the rhymes are well thought out. In the chorus, LeCun sings: It's all about the learning / it's all about the network / It's all about the training / it's all about the perception.","formatted":"He first investigated this sequence in his famous Liber abaci of 1202, when he studied the growth in the population of rabbits based on idealized assumptions.

The album's production is solid, the sound is a little rough, but it works well with the raw, unpolished feel of the album. Lyrically, LeCun is a wordsmith, with a knack for clever rhymes. Let's take a closer look at some of the songs. Deep Learning is the title track of the album. In the song, LeCun talks about his vision for the future of AI. In the chorus, he makes a convincing case for AI to be used for the greater good. He sings:\n\nWe gotta think about the future, it's gonna be here soon / Maybe we can even put some AI in the moon / Think about the children, think about the next generation / Let's make sure we put the right systems in their foundation. LeCun's rap flow is on point in this song, and his voice stays right on beat. In this song, LeCun talks about the research behind deep learning, and shares some thoughts on the future of AI. LeCun's singing is at its best in this song. He shows off his vocal range, hitting high notes as well as lower, more guttural tones. The lyrics are also clever and the rhymes are well thought out. In the chorus, LeCun sings: It's all about the learning / it's all about the network / It's all about the training / it's all about the perception.","formatted":"He first investigated this sequence in his famous Liber abaci of 1202, when he studied the growth in the population of rabbits based on idealized assumptions. See the Fibonacci rabbits page for the details.\n\nHere is the recommendation letter that I wrote for an application to a dragon feeder position at the Magic Unicorn Corporation: Dear recruiter, I have known ___ for two years, and I believe that she would be an excellent dragon feeder for the Magic Unicorn Corporation. ___ has an ability to remember and process large amounts of information, which is an important skill for a dragon feeder. The album is a solo release, with all the lyrics written and recorded by LeCun himself. In fact, he also composed and produced every song. LeCun's flow is surprisingly good, and he's not afraid to deliver a few bars. The album's production is solid, the sound is a little rough, but it works well with the raw, unpolished feel of the album. Lyrically, LeCun is a wordsmith, with a knack for clever rhymes. Let's take a closer look at some of the songs. Deep Learning is the title track of the album. In the song, LeCun talks about his vision for the future of AI. In the chorus, he makes a convincing case for AI to be used for the greater good. He sings:\n\nWe gotta think about the future, it's gonna be here soon / Maybe we can even put some AI in the moon / Think about the children, think about the next generation / Let's make sure we put the right systems in their foundation.

These models are trained on publicly available datasets and outperform GPT-3 on most benchmarks. The text also mentions the importance of scaling dataset and model sizes for a given compute budget, as well as the need to consider the inference budget when serving a language model at scale. The paper provides an overview of the modifications made to the transformer architecture and the training method used. It also reports the performance of the models and compares them with other large language models on standard benchmarks. Additionally, the text mentions the examination of biases and toxicity encoded in the models using recent benchmarks from the responsible AI community."
"The text discusses the training approach for a new large language model. It mentions that the approach is similar to previous work and is inspired by the Chinchilla scaling laws. The model is trained on a large quantity of textual data using a standard optimizer. The training dataset is a mixture of several sources, including English CommonCrawl, and the percentage representation of each source in the training set is provided. The CommonCrawl data is preprocessed to remove non-English pages and filter low-quality content. Pages not classified as references are discarded."
"The text discusses the inclusion of various datasets in a new large language model. The C4 dataset, obtained from CommonCrawl, is used after preprocessing that includes deduplication and language identification. The GitHub dataset is also utilized, with filtering based on licenses and quality heuristics. The text mentions the removal of hyperlinks, comments, and formatting boilerplate from the data. Additionally, two book corpora, Gutenberg Project and Books3, are included after deduplication at the book level. ArXiv Latex files are processed to add scientific data, with the removal of sections before the first section and the bibliography."
"The text discusses the modifications made to a large language model. These modifications include removing comments and expanding definitions and macros for consistency. The training dataset contains 1.4T tokens. The network is based on the transformer architecture and incorporates improvements from other models. Changes include normalizing the input instead of the output and using the SwiGLU activation function. The dimension used is 234d instead of 4d."
"The text discusses the use of rotary positional embeddings in a large language model. It also mentions the hyper-parameters used for training the models, including the optimizer, learning rate schedule, weight decay, and gradient clipping. The learning rate and batch size are adjusted based on the size of the model."
"The text discusses several optimizations made to improve the training speed of a large language model. These optimizations include using an efficient implementation of causal multi-head attention, reducing the amount of activations recomputed during the backward pass with checkpointing, reducing memory usage through model and sequence parallelism, and overlapping computation and communication between GPUs. The training speed achieved is approximately 380 tokens/sec/GPU on a specific GPU configuration, and training over a dataset with 1.4T tokens takes around 21 days."
"The article discusses the use of a large language model for zero-shot and few-shot tasks. It reports results on 20 benchmarks, where the model either generates answers or ranks proposed answers based on textual descriptions and test examples."
"The text discusses the comparison of the LLaMA language model with other existing models. It also mentions the evaluation of LLaMA on free-form generation tasks and multiple choice tasks.

The pass@1 results were obtained using a temperature of 0.1, while pass@100 and pass@80 metrics were obtained with a temperature of 0.8. The text also mentions that finetuning on code-specific tokens can improve performance, as demonstrated by models like PaLM-Coder. However, finetuning on code tokens is not the focus of the paper."
"The text discusses the evaluation of a large language model called LLaMA-65B on the massive multitask language understanding benchmark (MMLU). The results show that LLaMA-65B performs slightly worse than other models like Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B, possibly due to the limited amount of pre-training data used. The performance of the models improves during training and correlates with the model's perplexity. The instruct model LLaMA-I outperforms existing instruction finetuned models on MMLU but is still far from the state-of-the-art. The text also mentions the potential for large language models to reproduce biases and generate toxic content, highlighting the need for further evaluation and understanding of the risks associated with these models."
"The text discusses the issue of language models generating toxic content and the challenge of evaluating the extent of toxicity. The RealToxicityPrompts benchmark is mentioned as a way to measure toxicity, but the comparison with previous models is difficult due to the use of a third-party API. The text also mentions the measurement of toxicity scores for 100k prompts, with higher scores indicating more toxicity. It is noted that the size of the model affects the level of toxicity, particularly for Respectful prompts, which aligns with previous research."
"The text discusses the evaluation of biases in a new large language model. The evaluation is done using the CrowS-Pairs dataset, which measures biases in various categories. The model's preference for stereotypical sentences is measured using perplexity scores. The model is compared to GPT-3 and OPT-175B, and it is found to be slightly more biased in the religion category. The biases are believed to come from CommonCrawl despite filtering steps."
"The text discusses the investigation of biases in a large language model regarding gender. The WinoGender benchmark is used to evaluate biases in co-reference resolution, specifically in relation to occupations. The model's performance in determining co-reference is measured using different pronouns. The results show that the model is better at resolving co-reference for neutral pronouns compared to gender-specific pronouns, indicating a potential gender bias in the model's decision-making process."
"The text discusses the investigation of biases related to gender and occupation in a language model called LLaMA-65B. The model makes more errors on pronoun cases that do not match the majority gender of the occupation, indicating societal biases. The text also mentions a benchmark called TruthfulQA, which measures the truthfulness of a model in identifying true claims. The questions in this benchmark are designed to be adversarial and cover various categories. The performance of LLaMA-65B is compared to GPT-3, with LLaMA-65B scoring higher in both truthful and informative categories but still having a low rate of correct answers, suggesting the model may generate incorrect answers."
"The text discusses the energy consumption and carbon emissions associated with training large language models. It provides formulas for estimating the energy consumption and carbon emissions based on the power usage effectiveness and the location of the data center.
