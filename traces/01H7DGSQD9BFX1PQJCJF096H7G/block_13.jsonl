{"input":"ROUGEL-F1 22.10 the main contribution of this paper is the presentation of an impossibility theorem : consistency requiring that if an object is ranked at least as high as another in two independent problems , then it is ranked as high as the other in the unified problem , too and self -consistency a less known but intuitive property , introduced in xcite , which prohibits to assign a lower rank for an object with a better or equivalent performance than another can not be met simultaneously by any ranking method on the set of all problems . domain restrictions and weakening of the properties are also investigated in order to get some positive results . since self -consistency is an axiom difficult to debate , we can not demand consistency from a ranking method . at the first glance , it is a somewhat surprising and controversial result making the aggregation of ( incomplete ) preferences impossible . one may argue that the whole concept of paired comparisons -based ranking is flawed . however , loss of consistency may be regarded as a necessary sacrifice for dimension reduction since the outcome should be an inherently transitive ranking even from intransitive data . this interpretation is reinforced by the connection between consistency and independence of irrelevant matches ( which requires the relative ranking of two objects to be independent of the outcome of ... ... ... Gold assume a set of objects is given with information about their bilateral relationships , allowing for incomplete and multiple comparisons as well as different preference intensities . an axiomatic approach is applied for the problem of ranking the objects . consistency requires the preservation of relative ranking if two sets of such preferences are aggregated . self -consistency assigns the same rank for objects with the same performance , furthermore , an object should be ranked strictly higher if it shows an obviously better performance than another . it is revealed that these two properties can not be satisfied simultaneously . the impossibility holds under various restrictions on the domain . however , a positive result emerges if only the aggregation of ranking problems with the same comparison structure is allowed , for example , we have two round -robin tournaments .","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"Model consider a set of objects which should be ranked on the basis of information about their bilateral relationships . similar problems arise , among others , in social choice theory , sports , psychology , internet search , and bibliometrics . we discuss a universal version of the problem involving arbitrary preference intensities as well as incomplete and multiple comparisons . the main contribution of this paper is the presentation of an impossibility theorem : consistency requiring that if an object is ranked at least as high as another in two independent problems , then it is ranked as high as the other in the unified problem , too and self -consistency a less known but intuitive property , introduced in xcite , which prohibits to assign a lower rank for an object with a better or equivalent performance than another can not be met simultaneously by any ranking method on the set of all problems . domain restrictions and weakening of the properties are also investigated in order to get some positive results .","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"ROUGE1-F1 48.61 Document (ID #289) machine learning methods are used widely within high energy physics ( hep ) . one promising approach , used extensively outside of hep for applications such as handwriting recognition , is that of support vector machines ( svms ) , a supervised learning model used with associated learning algorithms for multivariate analysis ( mva ) . developed originally in the 1960s , with the current standard version proposed in 1995 xcite , svms aim to classify data points using a maximal margin hyperplane mapped from a linear classification problem to a possibly infinite dimensional hyperspace . however this means svms , like other mva classifiers , have a number of free parameters which need to be tuned on a case by case basis . this motivates a number methods for ensuring the classifier is sufficiently generalised such that when used on an unseen dataset the performance can be accurately predicted . in this paper a brief overview of svms is given in section [ sec : svm ] , with an example using svms shown in section [ sec : checker ] . generalisation is discussed in section [ sec : gen ] with an illustrative example of how this can improve performance given in section [ sec : check2 ] . consider the problem of linear classification with the svm where the training set , xmath0 , is linearly separable . we define a separating hyperplane given by xmath1 , where xmath2 , the weight vector , is perpendicular to the hyperplane , and xmath3 , the bias , determines the distance of the hyperplane from the origin ( fig .","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"we review the concept of support vector machines ( svms ) and discuss examples of their use . one of the benefits of svm algorithms , compared with neural networks and decision trees is that they can be less susceptible to over fitting than those other algorithms are to over training . this issue is related to the generalisation of a multivariate algorithm ( mva ) ; a problem that has often been overlooked in particle physics . we discuss cross validation and how this can be used to improve the generalisation of a mva in the context of high energy physics analyses . the examples presented use the toolkit for multivariate analysis ( tmva ) based on root and describe our improvements to the svm functionality and new tools introduced for cross validation within this framework .","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"Model support vector machines ( svms ) are one of the most promising methods for machine learning in high energy physics . svms aim to classify data points using a maximal margin hyperplane mapped from a linear classification problem to a possibly infinite dimensional hyperspace . however this means svms , like other mva classifiers , have a number of free parameters which need to be tuned on a case by case basis . this motivates a number methods for ensuring the classifier is sufficiently generalised such that when used on an unseen dataset the performance can be accurately predicted . in this paper a brief overview of svms is given , with an example using svms shown in section [ sec : checker ] . generalisation is discussed with an illustrative example of how this can improve performance given in section [ sec : gen ] .","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"Model the diagonal and tomographic representations of quantum states are considered . the quantum states are represented in terms of the weighted sum of coherent -state xmath0 projectors . in the tomographic -probability representation , the quantum state is associated with the so -called symplectic tomogram . the tomographic -probability distribution is a fair probability distribution containing the same information on quantum state that the density operator does ( or such its characteristics as the wigner or husimi kano functions ) . the aim of this work is to find the explicit formulae realizing the connection of the diagonal and tomographic probability representations . the functions like the wigner function , husimi kano function and tomographic -probability -distribution function are considered as symbols of the density operators of a corresponding star -product scheme . the superposition rule given in terms of tomograms and in terms of weight functions of the diagonal representation where explicit kernels of the corresponding star -products are employed to obtain the addition rules for the tomograms and weight functions are considered . we discuss also the formulation of the separability and entanglement properties of composed system in the tomographic probability and diagonal representations .","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"as the complexity of deep neural networks ( dnns ) trend to grow to absorb the increasing sizes of data , memory and energy consumption has been receiving more and more attentions for industrial applications , especially on mobile devices . this paper presents a novel structure based on functional hashing to compress dnns , namely funhashnn . for each entry in a deep net , funhashnn uses multiple low -cost hash functions to fetch values in the compression space , and then employs a small reconstruction network to recover that entry . the reconstruction network is plugged into the whole network and trained jointly . funhashnn includes the recently proposed hashednets xcite as a degenerated case , and benefits from larger value capacity and less reconstruction loss . we further discuss extensions with dual space hashing and multi -hops . on several benchmark datasets , funhashnn demonstrates high compression ratios with little loss on prediction accuracy .","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"Model deep neural networks ( dnns ) have been receiving ubiquitous success in wide applications , ranging from computer vision to speech recognition . as the sizes of data mount up , people usually have to increase the number of parameters in dnns so as to absorb the vast volume of supervision . compressing the model size becomes more important for applications on mobile and embedded devices . with different intuitions , there are mainly two types of dnn compression methods , which could be used in conjunction for better parameter savings . the first type tries to revise the training target into more informative supervision using dark knowledge . the second type observes the redundancy existence in network weights , and exploits techniques to constrain or reduce the number of free -parameters in dnns during learning . in applications , we observe hashednets compresses model sizes greatly at marginal loss of accuracy for some situations , whereas also significantly loses accuracy for others . after revisiting its mechanism , we conjecture this instability comes from at least three factors . first , hashing and training are disjoint in a two -phase manner , i.e. , once inappropriate collisions exist , there may be no much optimization room left for training . second , one single hash ROUGE2-F1 7.21 the alice experiment is dedicated to the study of the properties of qcd matter created in nucleus -nucleus collisions at lhc energies xcite . the inner tracking system in the alice apparatus is made of position sensitive detectors which have to handle several thousands tracks per unit of rapidity . the two innermost layers at 3.9 xmath10 and 7.6 xmath10 radii , respectively , constitute the silicon pixel detector ( spd ) . the spatial precision and hit efficiency of the spd are key parameters since they determine the alice capability of detecting particles with open heavy -flavour xcite . + the basic detector unit of the alice spd is the ladder , a two -dimensional silicon matrix of pxmath11n reverse biased diodes of dimensions 50 x 425 xmath12 , flip -chip bonded to five read -out chips . each diode is connected to a cell of the front -end read -out asic via a pb -sn solder bump of 25 xmath13 diameter . the detector contains nearly 10xmath14 active cells in total . the read -out is binary . to reduce the material budget , the sensor thickness is limited to 200 xmath13 and the read -out chip wafers are thinned down to 150 xmath13 . further details can be found in xcite . + early prototypes of the alice spd elements , in the form of single -chip assemblies , were tested in high energy proton / pion beams at the cern sps in 2002 and 2003 . these assemblies were made with sensors of 200 xmath13 and 300 xmath13 thicknesses , while the read -out chips ( unthinned ) were 725 xmath13 thick . those beam tests were primarily aimed at evaluating the performance of ... ... ...","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"ROUGE1-F1 31.25 a positive family history of prostate cancer ( pca ) is an established risk factor for pca . first -degree relatives of affected men have a 23 fold increased risk of pca . when 3 or more first -degree relatives are affected ( or at least 2 first -degree relatives before the age of 55 years ) , the family is considered a hereditary prostate cancer ( hpc ) family according to the so -called johns hopkins or carter criteria . yet , only a few very rare high -penetrance gene mutations have been identified to cause hpc . in recent years , genome -wide association studies have added approximately 40 low -penetrance genetic polymorphisms that are associated with an increased risk of pca [ 4 , 5 ] . several polymorphisms have also been identified that are associated with serum prostate -specific antigen ( psa ) , the most commonly used marker for early detection of pca [ 6 , 7 ] . an ongoing matter of debate is whether psa testing should be used for population -wide screening . in a population -based setting , the european randomized study of screening for prostate cancer ( erspc ) showed a decrease in pca mortality of 31% in the screening arm after correction for non -attendance and contamination . by contrast , the prostate , lung , colorectal and ovarian cancer screening trial ( plco ) , found no effect of psa screening on mortality , but suffered from methodological problems which severely hamper interpretation of the results . previous studies into the effectiveness of psa sceening in men with an increased risk due to family history have yielded largely inconsistent results . these range from a marked benefit ... ... ... Gold a family history of prostate cancer ( pca ) is an established risk factor for pca . in case of a positive family history , the balance between positive and adverse effects of prostate -specific antigen ( psa ) testing might be different from the general population , for which the european randomized study of screening for prostate cancer ( erspc ) showed a beneficial effect on mortality . this , however , went at the cost of considerable overtreatment . this study assessed dutch physicians knowledge of heredity and pca and their post -erspc attitude towards pca testing , including consideration of family history . in january 2010 , all dutch urologists and clinical geneticists ( cgs ) and 300 general practitioners ( gps ) were invited by email to complete an anonymous online survey , which contained questions about hereditary pca and their attitudes towards pca case -finding and screening . 109 urologists ( 31% ) , 69 gps ( 23% ) and 46 cgs ( 31% ) completed the survey . cgs had the most accurate knowledge of hereditary pca . all but 1 cg mentioned at least one inherited trait with pca , compared to only 25% of urologists and 9% of gps Model purposea positive family history of prostate cancer ( pca ) is an established risk factor for pca . to guide the public and physicians in translating the results of the european randomized study of screening for prostate cancer ( erspc ) and the prostate , lung , colorectal and ovarian cancer screening trial ( plco ) into clinical practice , the dutch association of urology ( nvu ) and the dutch college of general practitioners ( nhg ) concurrently released a policy statement in march 2009 . to date , in absence of official internationally accepted guidelines , the advice is to attempt to distinguish genetic predisposition -based families with multiple pca cases from ascertainment -based multiple -case families and offer pca testing only to the former . this study assessed the knowledge of dutch urologists , general practitioners ( gps ) and clinical geneticists ( cgs ) about hpc and pca as a phenotype in hereditary syndromes and their post -erspc attitude towards pca testing and the role of family history in clinical decision -making about pca testing.methodsonline surveys were sent to all dutch urologists ( n = 351 ) , gps ( n = 69 ) and cgs ( n = 50 ROUGE2-F1 24.86 Document (ID #72) this retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board of our hospital ( 2014 -09 -037 ) . between november 2011 and october 2014 , 245 patients in the icu underwent bedside pdt with a ciaglia blue rhino percutaneous tracheostomy set ( cook medical , bloomington , in , usa ) due to prolonged endotracheal tube insertion . pdt was not performed in patients aged under 18 years , those with any pulsation palpated over the tracheostomy site , patients with a history of surgery or radiotherapy in the cervical region , and those with coagulopathy ( increased prothrombin time , inr \u00bf 2 ) . the first four procedures were performed by two physicians and one nurse using the standard technique , with one physician operating the bronchoscope while the other performed pdt . the next 55 procedures were performed by one physician and one nurse , with the physician using the bronchoscope only to confirm and evaluate the proper depth for the endotracheal tube before performing pdt using the simplified method described below . the remaining 186 procedures were performed using the simplified technique after repositioning the endotracheal tube at the predetermined depth ( 17 cm for males and 15 cm for females at the incisor ) . all pdts were performed by a single physician and one nurse , both of whom fully understood the entire procedure . the nurse administered sedatives and analgesics , as well as repositioning the endotracheal tube . except for patients with limited neck extension , a small pillow was placed under the patient 's shoulders to slightly extend the neck . transverse markings were made at the cricothyroid membrane and 2.0 cm toward the sternal notch ( fig . was also made in the midline of the trachea ... ... ...","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"when first introduced , percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy ( pdt ) was performed using a bronchoscope . the bronchoscope itself , however , has several disadvantages , including interruption of ventilation . modifications of the standard pdt technique have suggested that pdt can be safely performed without a bronchoscope . however , the safety of these modifications is unclear and many modifications have yet to be widely adopted . this study retrospectively evaluated the safety of a simplified pdt technique using the cook ciaglia blue rhino in 186 patients . after confirming the underlying structures by palpation , pdt was performed without a bronchoscope or blunt dissection , 2.0 cm below the cricothyroid membrane . ultrasonography was used only when palpation was difficult . except for bleeding in three patients with coagulopathy , none of the patients experienced any early or late complications , and there were no deaths related to pdt . these findings confirm that pdt can be safely performed using a simplified technique , which may be useful in situations with limited equipment and medical personnel .","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"Model backgroundpercutaneous tracheostomy ( pdt ) is one of the most common tracheostomy procedures performed in the intensive care unit ( icu ) . although the use of a fiberoptic bronchoscope ( fob ) during pdt has been recommended for precise positioning and to avoid complications , bronchoscopy itself can cause complications . this study assessed the safety of a simplified pdt technique using the ciaglia blue rhino , by repositioning the existing endotracheal tube at a pre -determined depth and determining proper pdt site by superficial palpation.methodsbetween november 2011 and october 2014 , 245 patients in the icu underwent bedside pdt with a ciaglia blue rhino percutaneous tracheostomy set due to prolonged endotracheal tube insertion . the first four procedures were performed by two physicians and one nurse using the standard technique , with one physician operating the bronchoscope while the other performed pdt . the next 55 procedures were performed by one physician and one nurse , with the physician using the bronchoscope only to confirm and evaluate the proper depth for the endotracheal tube before performing pdt using the simplified method described below . the remaining 186 procedures were performed using the simplified technique after repositioning the endo ROUGE2-F1 10.53 stainless steel alloys have remained the material of choice despite the emergence of the more recent titanium , composite and polycarbonate orthodontic brackets . stainless steel alloy contains 8%-12% nickel , 17%-22% chromium and other elements such as copper , iron molybdenum , manganese , silicon and sulfur [3 -5 ] in the oral environment , orthodontic brackets are subjected to mechanical and chemical damaging which results in susceptibility to corrosion . corrosion leads to loss of substance from the material , change in its structural characteristics , or loss of structural integrity . due to the electrolytic capabilities of saliva various types of brackets are commercially available and each demonstrates a unique pattern of corrosion . in soldered brackets , this corrosion is due to the presence of dissimilar metals ( i.e. the silver solder and the stainless steel ) , a phenomenon termed galvanic corrosion . metal injection molding ( mim ) brackets are manufactured as a single unit and therefore do not demonstrate galvanic corrosion . corrosion can have detrimental effects on the surface of stainless steel brackets due to the continuous loss of metal ions . corrosion can increase the surface roughness of the bracket which leads to elevated friction forces between the bracket and the archwire . this increase in friction results in unfavorable distribution of forces and reduces the effectiveness of archwire guided orthodontic tooth movement.[7 -8 ] moreover , by means of increased stress , the friction would further accelerate the corrosion process . the release of metal ions following the corrosion of brackets has concerned clinicians and has instigated research in this field . among these metal ions , furthermore , direct and prolonged contact of orthodontic appliances and the resulting corrosion products have been shown to cause local pain and ... ... ...","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"statement of the problem : stainless steel brackets release metallic ions following the process of corrosion in the oral environment . these released ions have potential adverse effects on health , friction between wire and bracket , staining , strength of brackets . choosing a bracket with favorable corrosive properties ; therefore , should be a goal of every practitioner . purpose : the goal of this study is to compare the amount of corrosion among five different brands of brackets using inductively coupled plasma ( icp ) mass spectrometry . materials and method : five different brands of brackets ( dentaurum , 3 m , ortho organizer , cobas and o.r.g ) were chosen and ten brackets were selected from each brand . a piece of stainless steel wire was ligated to each bracket . the bracket -archwire complex was then immersed in artificial saliva . subsequently , the samples were analyzed using an icp device and the levels of iron , chromium , nickel , and manganese ions were measured . results : the findings of this study demonstrated that iron was released the most from the tested brackets , followed by nickel . we also found that the cobas bracket had the most ion release among the tested brackets ( p \u00a1 0.05 ) Model abstractobjectivesthe release of metal ions following the corrosion of brackets has concerned clinicians and has instigated research in this field . the present study aimed to investigate five different brands of stainless steel brackets and compare their tendency towards corrosion by measuring ion release in an in -vitro setting.material and methodsten central incisor brackets were selected from each brand . in order to simulate conventional orthodontic treatment , 8 mm of 0.016 stainless steel archwire was tied in each bracket using 10 mm of 0.25 mm ligature wire ( dentaurum , germany ) . once the brackets were prepared , they were placed in poly -ethylene capped vials containing 10 ml of artificial saliva at a ph of 7.2 . the vials were incubated at 37c for 6 weeks and then they were subjected to thermocycling with 500 temperature cycles from 5c to 55c to simulate the effect of temperature changes in the oral cavity . the brackets were immersed in each bath for 30 seconds with 2 seconds at air temperature in -between the immersions . the details of the brackets selected for the study after thermal -cycling the solutions from the vials were analyzed to determine the amount of nickel , chromium , manganese , and iron using an inductively coupled plasma spectrometer ( icp ) ROUGEL-F1 23.41 Document (ID #114) chronic pain affects up to 20% of the population in developed nations.14 this represents a profound impact on individuals and their families alongside the sizeable burden on employers , health care systems , and society in general.3 when chronic pain occurs , it has the potential to become disease itself , and subsequently , chronic pain has emerged as a distinct phenomenon.5 management of chronic pain varies greatly between nations and even within nations . literature supports a multidisciplinary approach as the standard of care , although various health care systems may not always support this concept consistently.2 the current standard of care for chronic , noncancer pain typically includes many disciplines with the clinician developing an individualized treatment plan with the options of utilizing surgical interventions , pharmacology , and psychological and physical therapies . opioid analgesics are often prescribed , despite the lack of clinical evidence supporting their long -term use in the management of chronic pain.6 however , for many patients , this multidisciplinary approach is inadequate or ineffectual or is accompanied by the burden of side effects that are unacceptable and debilitating . only at this late stage , the field of neuromodulation for the treatment of pain has developed rapidly since the seminal paper on the electrical inhibition of pain by the stimulation of the dorsal column almost 50 years ago.7 the original term of dorsal column stimulation has evolved to become known as spinal cord stimulation ( scs).8 scs has been particularly effective as an adjunct in treating mixed neuropathic / nociceptive and neuropathic / radicular pain conditions such as failed back surgery syndrome ( fbss ) and complex regional pain syndrome ( crps ) . neuromodulation therapies offer a treatment option that has minimal side effects and that is relatively safe and ... ... ...","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"spinal cord stimulation ( scs ) applications and technologies are fast advancing . new scs technologies are being used increasingly in the clinical environment , but often there is a lag period between the clinical application and the publishing of high -quality evidence on safety and efficacy . recent developments will undoubtedly expand the applicability of scs , allowing more effective and individualized treatment for patients , and may have the potential to salvage patients who have previously failed neuromodulation . already , high -level evidence exists for the safety , efficacy , and cost -effectiveness ( level i ii ) of traditional scs therapies in the treatment of chronic refractory low back with predominant limb pain ( regardless of surgical history ) . more than half of all patients with chronic painful conditions experience sustained and significant levels of pain reduction following scs treatment . although only limited evidence exists for burst stimulation , there is now level i evidence for both dorsal root ganglion scs and high -frequency scs that demonstrates compelling results compared with traditional therapies . the body of evidence built on traditional scs research may be redundant , with newer iterations of scs therapies such as dorsal root ganglion scs , high -frequency scs , and burst scs . a number of variables Model chronic pain affects up to 20% of the population in developed nations . the current standard of care for chronic , noncancer pain typically includes many disciplines with the clinician developing an individualized treatment plan with the options of utilizing surgical interventions , pharmacology , and psychological and physical therapies . however , for many patients , this multidisciplinary approach is inadequate or ineffectual or is accompanied by the burden of side effects that are unacceptable and debilitating . only at this late stage , the field of neuromodulation for the treatment of pain has developed rapidly since the seminal paper on the electrical inhibition of pain by the stimulation of the dorsal column almost 50 years ago . spinal cord stimulation ( scs ) has been particularly effective as an adjunct in treating mixed neuropathic / nociceptive and neuropathic / radicular pain conditions such as failed back surgery syndrome ( fbss ) and complex regional pain syndrome ( crps ) . in traditional scs therapies , the objective has been to replace the pain sensation with paresthesia that requires mapping of stimulation to the region of pain . in recent years , the next phase in the evolution of neuromodulation has become available with the development of dorsal root ganglion scs and the emerging use of two novel advances in stimulation frequencies ROUGEL-F1 17.68 As discussed during our recent demonstration of our new portfolio tracking system (PortRAC), we have completed a security system that will provide a \"firewall\" controlling access to each business unit's data.
