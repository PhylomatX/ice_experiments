{"prompt":"Here is a paragraph from a research paper: \"Neural language representation models such as BERT pre-trained on large-scale corpora can well capture rich semantic patterns from plain text, and be fine-tuned to consistently improve the performance of various NLP tasks. However, the existing pre-trained language models rarely consider incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs), which can provide rich structured knowledge facts for better language understanding. We argue that informative entities in KGs can enhance language representation with external knowledge. In this paper, we utilize both large-scale textual corpora and KGs to train an enhanced language representation model (ERNIE), which can take full advantage of lexical, syntactic, and knowledge information simultaneously. The experimental results have demonstrated that ERNIE achieves significant improvements on various knowledge-driven tasks, and meanwhile is comparable with the state-of-the-art model BERT on other common NLP tasks.

{"prompt":"Here is a paragraph from a research paper: \"C-GCN. Zhang et al. (2018) adopt the graph convolution operations to model dependency trees for relation classification. To encode the word order and reduce the side effect of errors in dependency parsing, Contextualized GCN (C-GCN) firstly uses Bi-LSTM to generate contextualized representations as input for GCN models. In addition to these three baselines, we also finetune BERT with the same input format introduced in Section 3.5 for fair comparison. As FewRel does not have any null instance where there is not any relation between entities, we adopt macro averaged metrics to present the model performances. Since FewRel is built by checking whether the sentences contain facts in Wikidata, we drop the related facts in KGs before pre-training for fair comparison. From Table 5, we have two observations: (1) As the training data does not have enough instances to train the CNN encoder from scratch, CNN just achieves an F1 score of 69.35%. However, the pre-training models including BERT and ERNIE increase the F1 score by at least 15%. (2) ERNIE achieves an absolute F1 increase of 3.4% over BERT, which means fusing external knowledge is very effective.\"\n\nQuestion: Does this paragraph answer the question 'How does the model extend or use previous work and models?'?

From Table 5 , we observe that: (1) The C-GCN model outperforms the strong BERT model by an F1 increase of 0.4%, as C-GCN utilizes the dependency trees and the entity mask strategy. The entity mask strategy refers to replacing each subject (and object similarly) entity with a special NER token, which is similar to our proposed pre-training task dEA.

{"input":"Neural language representation models such as BERT pre-trained on large-scale corpora can well capture rich semantic patterns from plain text, and be fine-tuned to consistently improve the performance of various NLP tasks. However, the existing pre-trained language models rarely consider incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs), which can provide rich structured knowledge facts for better language understanding. We argue that informative entities in KGs can enhance language representation with external knowledge. In this paper, we utilize both large-scale textual corpora and KGs to train an enhanced language representation model (ERNIE), which can take full advantage of lexical, syntactic, and knowledge information simultaneously. The experimental results have demonstrated that ERNIE achieves significant improvements on various knowledge-driven tasks, and meanwhile is comparable with the state-of-the-art model BERT on other common NLP tasks.

{"input":"Although pre-trained language representation models have achieved promising results and worked as a routine component in many NLP tasks, they neglect to incorporate knowledge information for language understanding. As shown in Figure 1 , without knowing Blowin' in the Wind and Chronicles: Volume One are song and book respectively, it is difficult to recognize the two occupations of Bob Dylan, i.e., songwriter and writer, on the entity typing task. Furthermore, it is nearly impossible to extract the fine-grained relations, such as composer and author on the relation classification task. For the existing pre-trained language representation models, these two sentences are syntactically ambiguous, like \"UNK wrote UNK in UNK\".

{"input":"(1) For extracting and encoding knowledge information, we firstly recognize named entity mentions in text and then align these mentions to their corresponding entities in KGs. Instead of directly using the graph-based facts in KGs, we encode the graph structure of KGs with knowledge embedding algorithms like TransE (Bordes et al., 2013), and then take the informative entity embeddings as input for ERNIE. Based on the alignments between text and KGs, ERNIE integrates entity representations in the knowledge module into the underlying layers of the semantic module.","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"(2) Similar to BERT, we adopt the masked language model and the next sentence prediction as the pre-training objectives. Besides, for the better fusion of textual and knowledge features, we design a new pre-training objective by randomly masking some of the named entity alignments in the input text and asking the model to select appropriate entities from KGs to complete the alignments. Unlike the existing pre-trained language representation models only utilizing local context to predict tokens, our objectives require models to aggregate both context and knowledge facts for predicting both tokens and entities, and lead to a knowledgeable language representation model.","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"The early work (Collobert and Weston, 2008;Mikolov et al., 2013;Pennington et al., 2014) focuses on adopting feature-based approaches to transform words into distributed representations. As these pre-trained word representations capture syntactic and semantic information in textual corpora, they are often used as input embeddings and initialization parameters for various NLP models, and offer significant improvements over random initialization parameters (Turian et al., 2010). Since these word-level models often suffer from the word polysemy, Peters et al.

{"input":"Different from the above-mentioned featurebased language approaches only using the pretrained language representations as input features, Dai and Le (2015) train auto-encoders on unlabeled text, and then use the pre-trained model architecture and parameters as a starting point for other specific NLP models. Inspired by Dai and Le (2015), more pre-trained language representation models for fine-tuning have been proposed. Howard and Ruder (2018) present AWD-LSTM (Merity et al., 2018) to build a universal language model (ULMFiT). Radford et al. (2018) propose a generative pre-trained Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) (GPT) to learn language representations. Devlin et al.

{"input":"Though both feature-based and fine-tuning language representation models have achieved great success, they ignore the incorporation of knowledge information. As demonstrated in recent work, injecting extra knowledge information can significantly enhance original models, such as reading comprehension (Mihaylov and Frank, 2018;Zhong et al., 2018), machine translation (Zaremoodi et al., 2018) The left part is the architecture of ERNIE.

{"input":"inference , knowledge acquisition (Han et al., 2018a), and dialog systems (Madotto et al., 2018). Hence, we argue that extra knowledge information can effectively benefit existing pre-training models. In fact, some work has attempted to joint representation learning of words and entities for effectively leveraging external KGs and achieved promising results (Wang et al., 2014;Toutanova et al., 2015;Han et al., 2016;Yamada et al., 2016;Cao et al., 2017Cao et al., , 2018. Sun et al. (2019) propose the knowledge masking strategy for masked language model to enhance language representation by knowledge 1 .

{"input":"In order to inject knowledge into language representation by informative entities, we propose a new pre-training task for ERNIE, which randomly masks some token-entity alignments and then requires the system to predict all corresponding entities based on aligned tokens. As our task is similar to training a denoising auto-encoder (Vincent et al., 2008), we refer to this procedure as a denoising entity auto-encoder (dEA). Considering that the size of E is quite large for the softmax layer, we thus only require the system to predict entities based on the given entity sequence instead of all entities in KGs. Given the token sequence {w 1 , . . . , w n } and its corresponding entity sequence {e 1 , . . . , e m }, we define the aligned entity distribution for the token w i as follows, .","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"For relation classification, the task requires systems to classify relation labels of given entity pairs based on context. The most straightforward way to fine-tune ERNIE for relation classification is to apply the pooling layer to the final output embeddings of the given entity mentions, and represent the given entity pair with the concatenation of their mention embeddings for classification. In this paper, we design another method, which modifies the input token sequence by adding two mark tokens to highlight entity mentions. These extra mark tokens play a similar role like position embeddings in the conventional relation classification models (Zeng et al., 2015). Then, we also take the [CLS] token embedding for classification.

{"input":"The specific fine-tuning procedure for entity typing is a simplified version of relation classification. As previous typing models make full use of both context embeddings and entity mention embeddings (Shimaoka et al., 2016;Yaghoobzadeh and Sch\u00fctze, 2017;Xin et al., 2018), we argue that the modified input sequence with the mention mark token [ENT] can guide ERNIE to combine both context information and entity mention information attentively.","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"The pre-training procedure primarily acts in accordance with the existing literature on pre-training language models. For the large cost of training ERNIE from scratch, we adopt the parameters of BERT released by Google 3 to initialize the Transformer blocks for encoding tokens. Since pre-training is a multi-task procedure consisting of NSP, MLM, and dEA, we use English Wikipedia as our pre-training corpus and align text to Wikidata. After converting the corpus into the formatted data for pre-training, the annotated input has nearly 4, 500M subwords and 140M entities, and discards the sentences having less than 3 entities.","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"We also evaluate ERNIE on the distantly supervised dataset, i.e., FIGER (Ling et al., 2015). As the powerful expression ability of deeply stacked Transformer blocks, we found small batch size would lead the model to overfit the training data. Hence, we use a larger batch size and less train- ing epochs to avoid overfitting, and keep the range of learning rate unchanged, i.e., batch size: 2048, number of epochs: 2, 3. As most datasets do not have entity annotations, we use TAGME (Ferragina and Scaiella, 2010) to extract the entity mentions in the sentences and link them to their corresponding entities in KGs.","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}
