{"input":"In order to inject knowledge into language representation by informative entities, we propose a new pre-training task for ERNIE, which randomly masks some token-entity alignments and then requires the system to predict all corresponding entities based on aligned tokens. As our task is similar to training a denoising auto-encoder (Vincent et al., 2008), we refer to this procedure as a denoising entity auto-encoder (dEA). Considering that the size of E is quite large for the softmax layer, we thus only require the system to predict entities based on the given entity sequence instead of all entities in KGs. Given the token sequence {w 1 , . . . , w n } and its corresponding entity sequence {e 1 , . . . , e m }, we define the aligned entity distribution for the token w i as follows, .","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"For relation classification, the task requires systems to classify relation labels of given entity pairs based on context. The most straightforward way to fine-tune ERNIE for relation classification is to apply the pooling layer to the final output embeddings of the given entity mentions, and represent the given entity pair with the concatenation of their mention embeddings for classification. In this paper, we design another method, which modifies the input token sequence by adding two mark tokens to highlight entity mentions. These extra mark tokens play a similar role like position embeddings in the conventional relation classification models (Zeng et al., 2015). Then, we also take the [CLS] token embedding for classification.

{"input":"The specific fine-tuning procedure for entity typing is a simplified version of relation classification. As previous typing models make full use of both context embeddings and entity mention embeddings (Shimaoka et al., 2016;Yaghoobzadeh and Sch\u00fctze, 2017;Xin et al., 2018), we argue that the modified input sequence with the mention mark token [ENT] can guide ERNIE to combine both context information and entity mention information attentively.","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"The pre-training procedure primarily acts in accordance with the existing literature on pre-training language models. For the large cost of training ERNIE from scratch, we adopt the parameters of BERT released by Google 3 to initialize the Transformer blocks for encoding tokens. Since pre-training is a multi-task procedure consisting of NSP, MLM, and dEA, we use English Wikipedia as our pre-training corpus and align text to Wikidata. After converting the corpus into the formatted data for pre-training, the annotated input has nearly 4, 500M subwords and 140M entities, and discards the sentences having less than 3 entities.","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"The total amount of parameters of BERT BASE is about 110M, which means the knowledgeable module of ERNIE is much smaller than the language module and has little impact on the run-time performance. And, we only pre-train ERNIE on the annotated corpus for one epoch. To accelerate the training process, we reduce the max sequence length from 512 to 256 as the computation of selfattention is a quadratic function of the length. To keep the number of tokens in a batch as same as BERT, we double the batch size to 512. Except for setting the learning rate as 5e \u22125 , we largely follow the pre-training hyper-parameters used in BERT. For fine-tuning, most hyper-parameters are the same as pre-training, except batch size, learning rate, and number of training epochs. We find the following ranges of possible values work well on the training datasets with gold annotations, i.e., batch size: 32, learning rate (Adam): 5e \u22125 , 3e \u22125 , 2e \u22125 , number of epochs ranging from 3 to 10.","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"We also evaluate ERNIE on the distantly supervised dataset, i.e., FIGER (Ling et al., 2015). As the powerful expression ability of deeply stacked Transformer blocks, we found small batch size would lead the model to overfit the training data. Hence, we use a larger batch size and less train- ing epochs to avoid overfitting, and keep the range of learning rate unchanged, i.e., batch size: 2048, number of epochs: 2, 3. As most datasets do not have entity annotations, we use TAGME (Ferragina and Scaiella, 2010) to extract the entity mentions in the sentences and link them to their corresponding entities in KGs.","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"Given an entity mention and its context, entity typing requires systems to label the entity mention with its respective semantic types. To evaluate performance on this task, we fine-tune ERNIE on two well-established datasets FIGER (Ling et al., 2015) and Open Entity . The training set of FIGER is labeled with distant supervision, and its test set is annotated by human. Open Entity is a completely manually-annotated dataset. The statistics of these two datasets are shown in Table 1 . We compare our model with the following baseline models for entity typing: NFGEC. NFGEC is a hybrid model proposed by Shimaoka et al. (2016). NFGEC combines the representations of entity mention, context and extra hand-craft features as input, and is the stateof-the-art model on FIGER. As this paper focuses on comparing the general language representation abilities of various neural models, we thus do not use the hand-craft features in this work.","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"The results on FIGER are shown in Table 2 . From the results, we observe that: (1) BERT achieves comparable results with NFGEC on the macro and micro metrics. However, BERT has lower accuracy than the best NFGEC model. As strict accuracy is the ratio of instances whose predictions are identical to human annotations, it illustrates some wrong labels from distant supervision are learned by BERT due to its powerful fitting ability. (2) Compared with BERT, ERNIE significantly improves the strict accuracy, indicating the external knowledge regularizes ERNIE to avoid fitting the noisy labels and accordingly benefits entity typing.","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"The results on Open Entity are shown in Table 3. From the table, we observe that: (1) BERT and ERNIE achieve much higher recall scores than the previous entity typing models, which means pre-training language models make full use of both the unsupervised pre-training and manuallyannotated training data for better entity typing. (2) Compared to BERT, ERNIE improves the precision by 2% and the recall by 2%, which means the informative entities help ERNIE predict the labels more precisely.","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"C-GCN. Zhang et al. (2018) adopt the graph convolution operations to model dependency trees for relation classification. To encode the word order and reduce the side effect of errors in dependency parsing, Contextualized GCN (C-GCN) firstly uses Bi-LSTM to generate contextualized representations as input for GCN models. In addition to these three baselines, we also finetune BERT with the same input format introduced in Section 3.5 for fair comparison. As FewRel does not have any null instance where there is not any relation between entities, we adopt macro averaged metrics to present the model performances. Since FewRel is built by checking whether the sentences contain facts in Wikidata, we drop the related facts in KGs before pre-training for fair comparison. From Table 5, we have two observations: (1) As the training data does not have enough instances to train the CNN encoder from scratch, CNN just achieves an F1 score of 69.35%. However, the pre-training models including BERT and ERNIE increase the F1 score by at least 15%.

{"input":"In TACRED, there are nearly 80% null instances so that we follow the previous work (Zhang et al., 2017) to adopt micro averaged metrics to represent the model performances instead of the macro. The results of CNN, PA-LSTM, and C-GCN come from the paper by Zhang et al. (2018), which are the best results of CNN, RNN, and GCN respectively. From Table 5 , we observe that: (1) The C-GCN model outperforms the strong BERT model by an F1 increase of 0.4%, as C-GCN utilizes the dependency trees and the entity mask strategy. The entity mask strategy refers to replacing each subject (and object similarly) entity with a special NER token, which is similar to our proposed pre-training task dEA. (2) ERNIE achieves the best recall and F1 scores, and increases the F1 of BERT by nearly 2.0%, which proves the effectiveness of the knowledgeable module for relation classification.","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}

{"input":"In this paper, we propose ERNIE to incorporate knowledge information into language representation models. Accordingly, we propose the knowledgeable aggregator and the pre-training task dEA for better fusion of heterogeneous information from both text and KGs. The experimental results demonstrate that ERNIE has better abilities of both denoising distantly supervised data and fine-tuning on limited data than BERT. There are three important directions remain for future research: (1) inject knowledge into feature-based pre-training models such as ELMo (Peters et al., 2018); (2) introduce diverse structured knowledge into language representation models such as Con-ceptNet (Speer and Havasi, 2012) which is different from the world knowledge database Wikidata;","model":"text-embedding-ada-002","cache_id":0}
